None, however, have been stretched as far as roguelikes and roguelites. You’ve probably heard these terms used to describe recent hit games such as <em>Hades</em>, <em>Dead Cells,</em> and <em>Binding of Isaac</em> and have wondered if there’s a difference. While both of these game types share a lot of common elements and the lines between them are seemingly blurred, there is a clear distinction between roguelikes and roguelites.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/isaac-poster.jpg"                      alt="isaac-poster"                ></p><hr><p><strong>This article contains:</strong></p><hr><p>Part 1: What’s the Difference Between Roguelikes and Roguelites?</p><hr><h3 id="Rogue-Where-it-all-started"><a href="#Rogue-Where-it-all-started" class="headerlink" title="Rogue: Where it all started"></a>Rogue: Where it all started</h3><p>In order to best understand these two game genres, we must first analyze the origin of their namesakes. Way back in 1980, game designers Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman released an ASCII art dungeon crawler called <em>Rogue</em>. Inspired by the pen-and-paper RPG <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, this turn-based adventure game had players explore dungeons in which they fought monsters and gathered items to help them power up their characters. The game’s defining mechanic was <strong>permadeath</strong>. This meant that once your character died, it was literally the end. You couldn’t create a save nor revive your fallen hero in any way. Starting over meant a completely fresh game with a brand new character. What’s more is that starting a new game meant the dungeons were completely different, including enemy placement, room location, and item distribution. Every decision could mean either living and carrying on or dying and starting over, making the choices players made meaningful.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/michael-toy-glenn-wichman.jpg"                      alt="michael-toy-glenn-wichman"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-a-Roguelike-Game"><a href="#What-is-a-Roguelike-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is a Roguelike Game?"></a>What is a Roguelike Game?</h2><p>As the name implies, a roguelike - or roguelike - is a game that shares the same mechanics that defined <em>Rogue</em>. They have procedurally generated environments, making every playthrough feel completely fresh and different. Dying in a roguelike means all progress is lost, and you need to start over, no saves, no lives, no ifs nor buts. It’s at this juncture where some debate exists as to what truly defines a roguelike. There are fans out there who’ll tell you that a roguelike must not only share the mechanics but also the game’s layout and combat system. According to them, since <em>Rogue</em> was a top-down third-person turn-based RPG that played on a grid, all true roguelikes should then play and look the same. The other camp sees roguelikes as purely defined by true permadeath with some leniency afforded with regards to less important elements such as player perspective, combat systems, and screen orientation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rogue-poster.jpg"                      alt="rogue-poster"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-a-Roguelite-Game"><a href="#What-is-a-Roguelite-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is a Roguelite Game?"></a>What is a Roguelite Game?</h2><p>Roguelites - or rogue-lites - in essence, employ a lighter approach to implementing <em>Rogue</em>‘s key characteristics. For the most part, roguelites still have permadeath. If you die, then you have to start over. However, the <strong>key difference</strong> is that roguelites allow you to carry over some form of progress from one playthrough to the next. Depending on the game, the way progress is carried over varies. Some games allow you to unlock additional items that can drop in a given run. Others open up access to new areas or provide you with abilities that enable you to traverse towards new locations and expand your area of exploration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unlock-hades.jpg"                      alt="unlock-hades"                ></p><p>Roguelites also have procedurally generated environments in a lot of cases. There are titles that have completely random level layouts and enemy placements. Others draw from a pre-defined set of layouts that are mixed and matched. Some titles may simply randomize more minute elements such as item placement and the locations of points of interest. Another way roguelites differ in the way they handle procedural generation is through seeded runs. A seed is essentially a run with pre-determined parameters, including enemy types and placements, level layout, and item availability. Seeding is also used to generate special challenge runs as well as enable custom modes. Whatever the case, roguelites have a tendency to reign in the chaos of fully procedurally generated game content.</p><p>It’s roguelites that are also usually a mix of different genres with <em>Rogue</em> style mechanics. From action RPGs to card games, the roguelite genre’s offerings are quite expansive. The leniency they give when it comes to permadeath and randomness affords developers more design space in which they can craft unique experiences.</p><hr><h2 id="A-Clear-Distinction"><a href="#A-Clear-Distinction" class="headerlink" title="A Clear Distinction"></a>A Clear Distinction</h2><p>Regardless of where you stand on what defines a faithful roguelike, the distinction between it and roguelites is quite straightforward. You know you are playing a roguelike when dying means you <strong>lose it all</strong>. No matter how far into the game you’ve progressed, one misstep means all of the time and work you put into your progress has come to an end. Roguelites, on the other hand, prefer to give you <strong>some sense of progression</strong>, making them <strong>friendlier</strong> for players who don’t want to play with the stress of potentially losing everything.</p><p>There’s an argument to be made that roguelikes give you a truly unique experience each time while roguelites end up becoming grindy and repetitive. When every little decision you make can lead you to lose your character and progress, you become more focused on your run, rather than the game as a whole. You’re forced to play your best, scrutinize every possible choice, and make meaningful comparisons between items and gear you come across. The risk is higher when playing roguelikes, but the reward and payoff of making it far in a run are quite big.</p><p>If you were to conclude that roguelikes are for the <strong>hardest of core gamers</strong> and roguelites are more <strong>casual</strong> in nature, you would be quite close to the mark. A lot of roguelite titles, however, have difficulty settings that can turn them into absolutely brutal experiences, rendering progress and unlocks less important than the player’s overall skill.</p><hr><p>Part 2: Examples of Roguelike and Roguelite Titles</p><p>If you’ve been meaning to dive into either or both of these genres, we’ve got a few titles for you to check out.</p><p><strong>You might also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Roguelike or Roguelite Games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><h3 id="Roguelike-Games"><a href="#Roguelike-Games" class="headerlink" title="Roguelike Games"></a>Roguelike Games</h3><p>For this list, we’re using the “true” definition of roguelike, meaning games that are almost exactly like <em>Rogue</em>.</p><h4 id="Nethack"><a href="#Nethack" class="headerlink" title="Nethack"></a>Nethack</h4><p><em>Nethack</em> is considered one of the most important roguelikes as it is as close to <em>Rogue</em> as a game can get. Apart from permadeath and procedurally generated environments, it shares a lot of <em>Rogue’s</em> core attributes, including the ASCII art style and screen layout. Compared to <em>Rogue</em>, <em>Nethack</em> has a much larger collection of enemies and items, making exploring its world more rewarding. <em>Nethack</em> also includes “conducts” which are special limitations players can choose to impose upon themselves in order to make the game even more challenging.</p><h4 id="Caves-of-Qud"><a href="#Caves-of-Qud" class="headerlink" title="Caves of Qud"></a>Caves of Qud</h4><p>Straying a bit from <em>Rogue’s</em> high fantasy setting, <em>Caves of Qud</em> mixes some science fiction into its world. Just like <em>Rogue</em>, dying means your progress goes caput. Environments, however, are only partially generated randomly, with some elements being pre-defined. The game also includes a robust mutation system to power up your character as well as quests and side-quests which you can choose to follow or ignore. On top of all this, <em>Caves of Qud</em> adds another layer of randomness through its procedurally generated political systems.</p><h4 id="Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup"><a href="#Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup" class="headerlink" title="Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup"></a>Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</h4><p>Recognized as one of the best roguelikes of all time, <em>Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</em> is one of the true innovators of its space. Taking all of the core defining elements of <em>Rogue</em>, including its hyper retro art style, <em>DCSS</em> makes a concerted effort towards being more accessible. For starters, it offers a more user-friendly interface that brings all important information to the forefront. The developers also wanted to make its gameplay far easier to understand so that any person can pick it up and play without needing any convoluted prior knowledge of how the game works.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dungeon-crawl-stone-soup.png"                      alt="dungeon-crawl-stone-soup"                ></p><hr><h3 id="Roguelite-Games"><a href="#Roguelite-Games" class="headerlink" title="Roguelite Games"></a>Roguelite Games</h3><p>For this genre, we’ve chosen three games that are completely different to illustrate the wider variety of titles that exists within the roguelite space.</p><h4 id="Dead-Cells"><a href="#Dead-Cells" class="headerlink" title="Dead Cells"></a>Dead Cells</h4><p><em>Dead Cells</em> is an exploration-based action platformer (a.k.a. a metroidvania) with roguelite elements. Just like all _Rogue_-based games, dying in <em>Dead Cells</em> means you start over from the beginning. However, not <strong>all progress</strong> is lost. As you progress through various biomes of the game, you’ll unlock new traversal abilities that allow you to access new biomes and pathways. While some randomness exists in each biome, it feels less like levels are procedurally generated and more like a mixing of pre-determined layout components. You’ll also stumble upon blueprints for items which you can then spend Cells you gather to make the items available to drop in future runs. By beating the game’s final boss you can unlock progressively harder difficulties, making the game increasingly more brutal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deadcells-poster.png"                      alt="deadcells-poster"                ></p><h4 id="Slay-the-Spire"><a href="#Slay-the-Spire" class="headerlink" title="Slay the Spire"></a>Slay the Spire</h4><p>One of the most highly praised indie games, MegaCrit’s <em>Slay the Spire</em> is a shining example of a perfect blend of genres. It’s a deckbuilding card game where you must climb the titular Spire while defeating enemies and bosses in turn-based card battles, so you can ultimately slay its heart. Each run consists of 3 Acts, each of which gives you choices of pathways that are procedurally generated. While enemy placement is somewhat controlled at first, it becomes more truly random the higher you climb. What makes StS particularly challenging is that it affords very few options to restore health so guarding your HP is vital. While death does mean you’ll have to start all the way from the bottom, you can unlock new cards for each of the game’s 4 classes as you level them up. The game also offers a wide variety of options for challenges and seeded custom runs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slay-the-spire.png"                      alt="slay-the-spire"                ></p><h4 id="Hades"><a href="#Hades" class="headerlink" title="Hades"></a>Hades</h4><p>Nominated for a Game of the Year award, <em>Hades</em> is a beloved title that has converted many gamers to the roguelite genre. Your aim in the game, as the son of Hades, is to escape the Ancient Greek hell and ascend to the top of Olympus with the rest of the pantheon. The gameplay is fast-paced action hack-and-slash but it’s in a top-down perspective which makes it feel a lot closer to <em>Rogue</em> than other games in the genre. It also has a lot of elements that are randomized, including the location of helpful shops. Your build will also feel wildly different between runs as even the Gods that appear to power you up are random as well as the abilities they offer you to choose from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirror-hades.png"                      alt="deadcells-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Bonus:</strong> With thousand of effects, Filmora X help you record your gameplay and edit it into nice montage.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-maximizing-obs-on-android-effective-practices/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Maximizing OBS on Android  Effective Practices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-obs-streaming-windows-and-mac-guide/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, OBS Streaming [Windows and Mac Guide]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-real-time-visual-documentation/"><u>In 2024, Real-Time Visual Documentation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-the-full-potential-of-zooms-visual-features/"><u>2024 Approved  Unlocking the Full Potential of Zoom's Visual Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-from-words-to-memos-iphone-sound-guide-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] From Words to Memos  IPhone Sound Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-inaugural-recording-evaluation-guide/"><u>In 2024, Inaugural Recording Evaluation Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-is-itops-performance-worth-your-investment-in-2024/"><u>[Updated] Is ITop's Performance Worth Your Investment, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-step-into-retro-gaming-with-top-5-ps1-emulators-for-pc/"><u>[New] In 2024, Step Into Retro Gaming with Top 5 PS1 Emulators for PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/streamline-your-workflow-essential-tips-to-record-on-hp-laptop-for-2024/"><u>Streamline Your Workflow  Essential Tips to Record on HP Laptop for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/the-rhythm-of-reels-audio-syncing-for-insta-videos/"><u>The Rhythm of Reels  Audio Syncing for Insta Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-key-takeaways-from-reviewing-zdsofts-vision-recorder/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Key Takeaways From Reviewing ZDSoft's Vision Recorder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-breakthrough-youtube-success-essential-tips-from-creator-studio-guide-for-2024/"><u>[New] Breakthrough YouTube Success  Essential Tips From Creator Studio Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/in-2024-are-you-finding-it-challenging-to-convert-gifs-into-jpg-or-png-images-do-not-worry-the-best-free-online-tool-and-software-to-change-your-gif-into-pn/"><u>In 2024, Are You Finding It Challenging to Convert GIFs Into JPG or PNG Images?

You will see a new window will pop up for settings as shown in the figure below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-video-settings-go-to-settings.jpg"                      alt="obs video settings go to settings"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Settings-That-You-Should-Keep"><a href="#Step-2-Settings-That-You-Should-Keep" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Settings That You Should Keep"></a>Step 2: Settings That You Should Keep</h3><p>Starting with base resolution, it is the video resolution that we are going to send to the people who are going to watch our stream. So for the best one, click on it and choose <strong>1280*720</strong>.</p><p>Output tab, which is the resolution of the video that the people will watch. For fast and lag-free streaming it’s best to keep both the output and base resolution the same to avoid any conversion between the resolution by CPU. So click on output resolution and choose <strong>1280*720</strong> again. If you noticed your computer is still lagging then it’s best to change to 480p but below this, it’s not recommended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-settings-that-you-should-keep.jpg"                      alt="obs settings that you should keep"                ></p><p>After that, it comes to the filter option. There are multiple filter options in this tab but for a fast and better result, you have to choose the <strong>“bilinear”</strong> filter as shown in the figure below. Finally, when it comes to frame per second you gotta be careful here. The more the fps the more it will put load on your CPU means it will become laggy but it is best to keep it <strong>30 fps</strong>, not more than this and not less than this if you are using a low-end PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Output-Settings"><a href="#Step-3-Output-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Output Settings"></a>Step 3: Output Settings</h3><p>Once you are done with the general video settings now it’s time you should come to the output settings. For that, you will need to choose the output from the main vertical tab as shown in the figure below in 1. You will see a new window appears with a variety of settings. Now it’s time to choose the advanced setting as shown in 2 in the figure to see all settings to be edited.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-settings-edited.jpg"                      alt="obs output settings edited"                ></p><p>Let’s move towards the detail settings for the output video for your audience it’s best to choose the settings shown in the figure and below for lag-free and jitter-free video.</p><p><strong>Encoder:</strong></p><p>The first setting is the encoder setting for your output video. There are two options for it, if you are not using any NVidia graphics card and relying on CPU then it is best to choose x264, which will utilize your CPU.</p><p><strong>Rescale Output:</strong></p><p>The rescale output settings should be kept the same as 720p of the video you are streaming.</p><p><strong>Rate Control:</strong></p><p>Keep the rate control CBR.</p><p><strong>Bitrate:</strong></p><p>Normally, for low-end PCs, you should keep the bitrate to 3000 kbps. However, if you are finding it struggling with your PC in the form of a lag or jitteriness then it’s recommended to drop it low till you get the better results. For the NVIDIA card keep the bitrate to 3000 as it is perfectly fine for it.</p><p><strong>CPU Usage Preset:</strong></p><p>It comes with a lot of options to keep your CPU usage for the video. It is best recommended to keep the CPU usage very fast for good results. If you are using an NVIDIA graphics card then it is best to change the CPU usage to “performance” to get the best out of your machine.</p><p><strong>Profile:</strong></p><p>By default, the profile option is disabled and you should keep these settings as it is if you are not using the NVIDIA card but if it’s not so then it’s recommended to choose the “main” on the profiling option.</p><p>So that’s it for the video settings. These are all the settings that you need to adjust before streaming. After doing it so you just need to click apply button below and bingo it is done.</p><h2 id="2-Audio-Settings"><a href="#2-Audio-Settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Settings"></a>2. Audio Settings</h2><p>For a clear and better audio performance, it’s also necessary you keep the optimum settings for the audio too. Well, you don’t have to worry now about the audio too. After reading this article you should keep the same audio settings here for your PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Output-Audio"><a href="#Step-1-Output-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Output Audio"></a>Step 1: Output Audio</h3><p>The audio settings can be adjusted from two places. Let us discuss the first one. For that, you will need to select the output in the vertical tab and go to audio as shown in the figure below. You will see multiple tracks in these windows. It contains the audio settings for multiple sources. However, if you are using a single it’s good to choose 320 in track one. For multiple, there is no need to change the audio track but to keep the same 320. These are the perfect settings for most cases of the audio settings for your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-audio-settings-adjust.jpg"                      alt="obs output audio settings adjust"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings"><a href="#Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Audio Tab Settings "></a>Step 2: Audio Tab Settings <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-audio-tab-settings-steps.jpg"                      alt="obs audio tab settings steps"                ></h3><p>The audio consists of many settings,it is divided into categories lets start one by one and explain it.</p><p><strong>Sample Rate and Channels:</strong></p><p>It is the resolution of the audio. The more the sampling rate the more the bits of the audio you sent which means the more the quality of the audio improves. However, there is no need to keep it high but an optimum value works well too. Therefore, keep it <strong>48khz</strong> for the best result as shown. Another thing is a channel, which contains a lot of options but most of you will want the <strong>“stereo”</strong> since it’s the most common choice from the streamers.</p><p><strong>Desktop Audios:</strong></p><p>The desktop audio depends on the device you are using for the audio. It is best to use the default if you don’t know about your device otherwise choose USB if you are audio uses the USB port. For the second audio source, you can choose desktop audio 2 and set it accordingly.</p><p><strong>Auxiliary Audio:</strong></p><p>The streamers usually have one mic source but if you have multiple mic sources then you choose up to 4 auxiliary audio ports and set the device’s settings.</p><p><strong>Meter: Decay Rate &amp; Peak Meter Type:</strong></p><p>The meter is a decibel meter (dB). It is a measurement of volume. The more the decibels, the more it is loud. So use the decay rate to choose between fast, medium, and slow volumes accordingly to your needs. The Peak Meter type is used for your CPU usage. IF you have set higher CPU usage then go for the “true peak” otherwise chose “sample peak”.</p><p>Finally, the rest of the options should be kept as default since being a streamer you won’t need them to change and they are pretty much basic hotkeys to set up if you wish to.</p><h2 id="3-Stream-Settings"><a href="#3-Stream-Settings" class="headerlink" title="3.

In addition, developers are continually innovating their programs to make your document processing easier. For example, you can now use google translate voice to text when you are typing a document for a diverse audience.</p><p>Below is a full guide on how to translate speech to text the right way with Google Translate. In addition, you will discover alternatives to google speech translate, including their summary and how they compare to one another.</p><h2 id="Part1-How-to-translate-speech-to-text-with-Google-Translate"><a href="#Part1-How-to-translate-speech-to-text-with-Google-Translate" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to translate speech to text with Google Translate?"></a>Part1: How to translate speech to text with Google Translate?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/google-speech-translate-1.jpg"                      alt="translate speech"                ></p><p>Google Translate is one of the easiest voice typing apps to use. However, before you go through the steps on how to use Google speech translate, here are a few points you need to consider:</p><ul><li>You need to have an external microphone to use google speech translate. Laptop and notebook owners can rely on their in-built microphone, and desktop users will need an external one. In addition, using a headset has better results than an external microphone.</li><li>Ensure you allow google translate voice to text to access your device’s microphone. You will find your microphone settings in the <strong>Control Panel</strong> for Windows and <strong>Preferences</strong> if you are a Mac user.</li><li>Unfortunately, you cannot upload audio files to Google speech translate. In addition, there is no information if subsequent updates of the app will include the feature.</li><li>Regarding Google speech to text pricing, the app is free to download and use. Although the service is available from the web browser, having an active Google account enables you to access its full features.</li><li>Although Google translate voice to text can detect your language, it does suffer accuracy issues occasionally. Therefore, confirm that you select the correct language before using the translation service.</li></ul><p>The above points apply to all versions of Google speech translate, whether on your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Now that you are aware of the app’s key user points, here is how you can translate speech to text with Google Translate:</p><p>1. Launch the app from your device’s home screen or the installation directory for computer users.</p><p>2. Select the languages you want to translate from the main screen using the arrow buttons on the bottom right corner of each box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/google-speech-translate-2.jpg"                      alt="arrow buttons"                ></p><p>For example, if you want to translate English to French, English will appear in the first box and French in the other. Kindly note that the app does not detect microphone input automatically. The feature is only available for typed text.</p><p>3. Proceed to the bottom of the page and click the Microphone button to begin translating your speech to text input. Ensure you are in a quiet environment for best results.</p><p>4. You can end your recording by clicking the Stop button.</p><p>5. You can listen to your translation by clicking the Listen button from the right box of Google speech translate. In addition, you can switch between playback speeds by pressing the Listen button repeatedly.</p><h2 id="Part2-How-to-translate-recorded-speeches-with-Google-Translate"><a href="#Part2-How-to-translate-recorded-speeches-with-Google-Translate" class="headerlink" title="Part2: How to translate recorded speeches with Google Translate?"></a>Part2: How to translate recorded speeches with Google Translate?</h2><p>Unfortunately, Google Translate does not support the translation of audio file uploads, such as recorded speeches and music files. The service only supports translation of the following file types;</p><ul><li>Docx</li><li>Pdf</li><li>Pptx</li><li>Xlsx</li></ul><p>It also allows you to translate websites in your browser automatically. Here is how to translate websites with Google Translate:</p><ol><li>Click on the Websites tab from the app’s home page.</li><li>Select the original language as Detect Language because the app refers to its over 100-language library to determine the source language. Inputting the wrong source language will result in an incorrect translation.</li><li>Type the URL you need to translate in the Website textbox and click Go to view the website in your preferred language.</li></ol><p>So, how can you translate recorded audio using Google Translate? Follow the below steps:</p><h3 id="Use-other-transcribe-tools-to-transcript-the-audio"><a href="#Use-other-transcribe-tools-to-transcript-the-audio" class="headerlink" title="Use other transcribe tools to transcript the audio"></a>Use other transcribe tools to transcript the audio</h3><p>As earlier mentioned, you can only use Google Translate with text documents and websites. As such, you need to transcribe the recorded speech using a different transcription app, then upload the transcript to Google Translate. The compatible file formats are .docx, .pdf, .pptx, and .xlsx.</p><p>Some of the transcribing apps you can use include, Trint, Rev, and Happy Scribe. In addition, check if the apps require you to purchase a subscription before using them. Although some apps offer free trials, your access may have feature limitations. For example, most apps limit transcription of recorded audio files to between five and sixty minutes, depending on the developer.</p><h3 id="Paste-to-Google-translate"><a href="#Paste-to-Google-translate" class="headerlink" title="Paste to Google translate"></a>Paste to Google translate</h3><p>Once you finish transcribing the speech recording from the third-party app, ensure you save it in the file formats indicated above. You will then follow the below steps to finish translating your speech recording.</p><ol><li>Launch Google Translate on your device.</li><li>Tap the Documents tab from the app’s home screen.</li><li>Select the Detect Language option for the left box, and choose your desired translation language for the right box. Typically, the app lists English, Spanish, and Arabic as the default language options. However, you will find additional languages by clicking the down arrow on the right. Google Translate has over 100 languages in its internal library, including Xhosa and Latin. Despite this, you should always check the translation accuracy before submitting your work. This is because the app can sometimes ignore the translation language’s grammar and punctuation rules.</li></ol><h3 id="What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Google-STT-Translation"><a href="#What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Google-STT-Translation" class="headerlink" title="What’s the Best Alternative to Google STT Translation?"></a>What’s the Best Alternative to Google STT Translation?</h3><p>Google translate voice to text is among the top voice typing apps in the market.

However, it fails to produce the output as a professional-quality video recorder. You cannot record video in 4K resolution and SplitCam lacks editing options after recording. Besides, there are limited output file formats available. Hence, we recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best alternative to SplitCam.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-method-for-iptv-screen-recordings-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Method for IPTV Screen Recordings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-capture-every-detail-advanced-skype-calls-recording-methods/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Capture Every Detail  Advanced Skype Calls Recording Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-green-screen-recording-tools/"><u>In 2024, Best Green Screen Recording Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/optimized-techniques-for-capturing-win10-games/"><u>Optimized Techniques for Capturing Win10 Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mastering-easy-ipad-video-recording-methods/"><u>[New] In 2024, Mastering Easy iPad Video Recording Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-a-complete-guide-to-utilizing-ios-screenshot-feature-for-2024/"><u>[New] A Complete Guide to Utilizing IO's Screenshot Feature for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-elite-audio-capture-top-9-mic-recorders-showcase-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Elite Audio Capture  Top 9 Mic Recorders Showcase for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/detailed-survey-gecatas-game-capture-utility-for-2024/"><u>Detailed Survey  Gecata's Game Capture Utility for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/complete-tutorial-to-use-vpna-to-fake-gps-location-on-motorola-g54-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Complete Tutorial to Use VPNa to Fake GPS Location On Motorola G54 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-step-by-step-save-instagram-videos-on-desktop-devices/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Step-by-Step  Save Instagram Videos on Desktop Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/s-top-picks-free-whiteboard-animation-software-for-windows-and-macos-for-2024/"><u>S Top Picks Free Whiteboard Animation Software for Windows and macOS for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/best-15-listeners-broadcasting-spaces-for-2024/"><u>Best 15 Listeners' Broadcasting Spaces for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-unlocking-instagrams-power-essential-5-tips-and-examples-from-pros/"><u>[Updated] Unlocking Instagram's Power  Essential 5 Tips & Examples From Pros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-optimizing-call-and-chat-preservation-in-the-digital-age-fb-edition/"><u>2024 Approved  Optimizing Call & Chat Preservation in the Digital Age  FB Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-seeking-outno-cost-clip-art-deposits/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Seeking Outno-Cost Clip Art Deposits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-effortless-tiktok-to-mp4-file-transformation-for-2024/"><u>[New] Effortless TikTok to MP4 File Transformation for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-premium-income-analysis-tools-for-tiktok-talent/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Premium Income Analysis Tools for TikTok Talent</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

A number of great development studios were closing, and even mainstream series like Need for Speed struggled to maintain their original popularity.</p><p>If you are a racing fan, then there is good news for you. Things are a lot better today as compared to the past. Several racing titles have been introduced over the years, like Forza Horizon, Assetto Corsa, iRacing, etc. We have seen several open-world racing games getting immense popularity among gamers. The simulation racing genre is more competitive than ever today. In July 2015, EA acquired Codemasters for a staggering $1.2 billion, illustrating how highly racing games have been valued for the last few years.</p><p>This article will present our top picks of the best sim racing games you can play right now.

Players can find their dream cars in this game.</li><li>The sim racing experience that it offers is unmatchable to any other game.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Assetto-Corsa-Assetto-Corsa-Competizione-3"><a href="#3-Assetto-Corsa-Assetto-Corsa-Competizione-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Assetto Corsa &#x2F; Assetto Corsa Competizione"></a>3.Assetto Corsa &#x2F; Assetto Corsa Competizione</h3><p><strong>Platforms</strong>: PC, PS4, Xbox One <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/assetto-corse-competizione-poster.jpg"                      alt="assetto-corse-competizione-poster"                ></p><p>The two experiences offered by Kunos Simulazioni are so different, yet both so good, that we’ve included them both. Assetto Corsa has seen better days, but it can still be an awesome driving sim with a few mods, and Competizione is getting better as it reaches iRacing as a pure racing sim. As far as GT racing is concerned, it is probably the healthiest and most diverse form of motorsports right now.</p><p>Assetto Corsa also has a number of useful force feedback options that will let you experience driving a car without having to feel it. You are likely to have the most difficulty getting used to a PC when you start. In reality, you’ll need to step it up when it’s time to get real.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The career mode provides a very real experience where you progress as a racer and earn titles and rewards.</li><li>The advanced physics engine makes it the next-generation simulation game.</li><li>Although the car selection is not so wide, if you don’t mind playing with mods, you won’t get bored with this game.</li><li>The best thing about this game is that you can play it using any kind of device like a keyboard, controller, joystick, etc.</li><li>It provides the best hardware compatibility.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Project-Cars-2-3"><a href="#4-Project-Cars-2-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Project Cars 2"></a>4.Project Cars 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/project-cars-2-poster.png"                      alt="project-cars-2-poster"                ></p><p>Project Cars 2 is likewise available on modern consoles, so you can also expect polish and presentation, including an offline career mode that is light but solid. Cars and tracks are abundant here, especially if you purchase the season pass along with numerous car packs.</p><p>Physicists have made these improvements to accommodate the physics engine, like in Assetto Corsa. Driving a car is fun because they are responsive and fun, but I always have difficulties connecting with them. The wide range of vehicles here, from two-stroke karts to four-wheel-drive rally vehicles, makes it all feel the same, which is a problem.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics is much better than the competition.</li><li>Classic and new cars are available.</li><li>Race tracks of even better quality.</li><li>Track and weather conditions that are dynamic.</li><li>The difficulty level can be adjusted very easily.</li><li>The PC version of this game has amazing VR.</li></ul><h3 id="5-rFactor-2-3"><a href="#5-rFactor-2-3" class="headerlink" title="5.rFactor 2"></a>5.rFactor 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rfactor2-poster.png"                      alt="rfactor2-poster"                ></p><p>We go way, way back with rFactor. Its core physics engine was used to power older iconic games, like F1 Challenge 2002. Ad-hoc online leagues and modified mods were my only choice back then. The list of licensed cars and tracks in rFactor 2 is now extensive (and is still growing), and it even includes some of the most competitive online racing series around.</p><p>RFactor 2 is the one game that gets seriously out of everything I’ve listed so far. The game doesn’t come with a half-dozen offline career modes or a complex licensing system that unlocks cars. There’s a menu where you choose where to race, which car to drive, and then you’re off. Offline racing is certainly possible, and the artificially intelligent competition will provide a good challenge, but the most frightful competition is usually to be found online – including the likes of Max Verstappen.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics of this game is the most complex among all sim racing games.</li><li>The handling of cars is way better.</li><li>Different weather and day and night conditions of the game make it much more appealing.</li><li>You can choose from some really high-quality mods with great mod support.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Sim racing is one of the most favorite sub-genre of racing lovers. So, we have presented you with a list of some of the best sim racing games that are available in the market right now. All these games work on almost the same physics. The only difference is between graphics, cars, maps, tracks, mods, and other technicalities. All games have their own pros and cons. Some offer the fastest cars while others offer better handling. It all comes down to user choice and preferences. If you are new to the sim racing environment, you can try all these titles and then decide which one suits you the best.</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-perfecting-your-on-air-presence-youtube-and-twitch-streaming-through-obs/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Perfecting Your On-Air Presence  YouTube & Twitch Streaming Through OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ultimate-racer-replicas-our-top-games/"><u>2024 Approved  Ultimate Racer Replicas  Our Top Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-tech-savvy-academics-recording-education-talks-with-macos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Tech-Savvy Academics  Recording Education Talks with MacOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-webcam-filming-made-professional-in-no-time/"><u>[New] In 2024, Webcam Filming Made Professional in No Time</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-streamlining-the-demo-process-in-adobe-captivate/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Streamlining the Demo Process in Adobe Captivate</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-elevate-video-quality-with-vlcs-high-resolution-webcam-recording/"><u>2024 Approved  Elevate Video Quality with VLC's High-Resolution Webcam Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-pro-level-snap-tech-free-from-any-delaying-hiccups-for-2024/"><u>[New] Pro-Level Snap Tech  Free From Any Delaying Hiccups for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-comprehensive-guide-to-optimizing-facetime-recording-quality/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Comprehensive Guide to Optimizing FaceTime Recording Quality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-remove-the-lock-screen-fingerprint-of-your-itel-a05s-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Remove the Lock Screen Fingerprint Of Your Itel A05s</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-perfect-your-mobile-photos-the-best-no-cost-slo-mo-camera-apps-guide/"><u>[New] Perfect Your Mobile Photos  The Best No-Cost Slo-Mo Camera Apps Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-innovative-list-of-top-10-affordable-video-chat-platforms-for-companies-and-institutions/"><u>In 2024, Innovative List of Top 10 Affordable Video Chat Platforms for Companies & Institutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/historical-knowledge-at-your-fingertips-best-yt-history-channels-for-2024/"><u>Historical Knowledge at Your Fingertips  Best YT History Channels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/iphone-13-pro-max-asking-for-passcode-after-ios-1714-update-what-to-do-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>iPhone 13 Pro Max Asking for Passcode after iOS 17/14 Update, What to Do? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-frp-on-infinix-note-30i-by-drfone-android-unlock-remove-google-frp/"><u>How To Bypass FRP on Infinix Note 30i</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-title-the-enigmatic-world-of-fibonacci-sequences-and-their-mathematical-implications-in-modern-science/"><u>New In 2024, Title The Enigmatic World of Fibonacci Sequences and Their Mathematical Implications in Modern Science</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="OptiBackup-Insider-Opinions"><a href="#OptiBackup-Insider-Opinions" class="headerlink" title="OptiBackup Insider Opinions"></a>OptiBackup Insider Opinions</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a screen recording program for Windows that allows users to capture a complete screen or a select area of it, as well as record narrator voice or system noises and improve the overall quality of the individual clip. Within a PC, the system may be utilized to create professional-looking films. Camera video recording is supported by EaseUS RecExperts, allowing users to shoot movies inside the webcam or as an overlay, allowing for higher levels of involvement. You may record the whole screen, a specific region, or even a locked window with EaseUS RecExperts. Additionally, while recording, you may annotate your screen, label an area, and do other editing activities. You can rapidly export or distribute your recording to various platforms, depending on your preferences.</p><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a multi-purpose but simple-to-use Windows screen recorder that allows you to record and capture everything on your computer’s screen. Thanks to its simple and well-organized interface, you can get started quickly. You may record your screen, audio, and camera independently or all at once. In addition, the game recording option enables you to record your games in whatever way you desire. Annotation, cutting, watermark insertion, and other sophisticated editing tools are included in the program. The recordings may be exported in a variety of file formats, including MP4, AVI, and WMV. They may even upload the created video to YouTube immediately. Noise reduction and audio enhancement are also included in the software’s capabilities. It comes with its game recording mode, capable of capturing popular 2D&#x2F;3D games in 4K UHD quality. Users may use the built-in task planner to complete their recording tasks on time and in an automatic manner.</p><h2 id="1-Price-and-Tech-Specifications"><a href="#1-Price-and-Tech-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="1. Price and Tech Specifications"></a>1. Price and Tech Specifications</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts cost $11.97 a month, $23.97 a year, or $69.95 for the rest of your life. A single license for one machine is included in this price. It’s worth noting that you can test out the program for free. The trial version restricts you to two-minute recordings and adds a watermark to your movies.</p><p>Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Mac OS are all supported by EaseUS RecExperts. Initially, EaseUS Screen Recorder was only available for Windows, but a Mac OS version was eventually published. The program will be installed as a standalone app on your system disk. There are no further add-ons required. When recording games, RecExperts also allows you to alter the frame rate up to 60 frames per second. RecExperts is starting to look like a first-class application for all kinds of on-screen recording requirements, with the ability to output to 10+ commonly used recording formats (including MP4, MOV, and MP3), the ability to make GIFs directly from screen captures, and the ability to automatically stop and split recordings based on time or file size limits.</p><h2 id="2-How-to-Use-RecExperts"><a href="#2-How-to-Use-RecExperts" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Use RecExperts"></a>2. How to Use RecExperts</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a premium screen recording software for Windows and Mac OS created by EaseUS.com. It’s a multi-purpose screen recorder that can do both screen recording and Webcam recording. RecExperts may also record full-screen or a specific part of the screen. The free trial version of RecExperts can be downloaded fast and conveniently from the EaseUS website, and the installation can be started right away.</p><p>Step 1: Launch EaseUS RecExperts</p><p>As can be seen in the screenshot below, the first function that is pre-selected for us when we launch the RecExperts program is the one that is necessary for capturing the complete default computer display. We have simple access to all of the software’s key functionalities as well as the main settings menu for modifying, among other things, the default file formats utilized, from this main program window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/easeus-recexperts.jpg"                      alt="easeus recexperts"                ></p><p>Step 2: Setup the Recording</p><p>For improved content distribution, you may record the single Webcam or use the Webcam as an overlay on a movie. With simplicity, you may pick full-screen recording, a specific portion of the screen, or a single window. Simply pressing the orange “REC” button will start the recording process; the main program windows will vanish at this point, being replaced by a smaller control window, as seen below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-setup-the-recording.jpg"                      alt="setup the recording"                ></p><p>Step 3: Finish&#x2F;Save Recording</p><p>We may finish the recording by clicking the red “stop” button after the screen recording is complete (which will, by default, include any sound outputted by the device during this process). When the recording is finished and the stop button is pushed, the RecExperts program will open the freshly recorded clip in the RecExperts editing suite, where we may continue to work with the material:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-recoring.jpg"                      alt="save recording"                ></p><h2 id="3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="3.

A <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video conferencing application <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> like Zoom enables you to organize your calendar weeks or even months in advance by scheduling meetings for a particular date.</p><p> Scheduling a Zoom meeting isn’t much more difficult than starting a new meeting on Zoom, as this is a built-in option that is available on all versions of the app. So, in this article, we are going to show you how to schedule meetings on Zoom from your web browser, a computer or a mobile device.</p><h2 id="How-to-Schedule-Zoom-Meetings-from-a-Web-Browser"><a href="#How-to-Schedule-Zoom-Meetings-from-a-Web-Browser" class="headerlink" title="How to Schedule Zoom Meetings from a Web Browser?"></a>How to Schedule Zoom Meetings from a Web Browser?</h2><p> Zoom offers extensions for both Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome that make the scheduling process faster and easier. However, you don’t have to install these extensions to your web browser in order to schedule a meeting, as this task can also be performed from the Zoom web portal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/schedule-zoom-meeting-web.jpg"                      alt="Schedule Zoom Meetings in Web"                ></p><p> Click on the <strong>Meetings</strong> tab after signing in to your Zoom account, and then click on the <strong>Schedule a New Meeting</strong> button that is located in the Upcoming Meetings tab. You can then start customizing the meeting’s options by adding a topic, creating a full description of the meeting or setting the date and time of the meeting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-schedule-meeting-interface.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Schedule Meeting Interface"                ></p><p> Zoom also lets you specify the duration of a meeting, but you don’t have to worry about entering the exact duration of a meeting since the meeting is not going to end automatically after the specified period of time expires.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/schedule-zoom-meeting-settings.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Schedule Meeting Interface Settings"                ></p><p> Furthermore, you can decide if the password for a meeting is mandatory, enable the host and participant video option or allow attendees to join using Computer audio, Telephone audio or both. As a host of the meeting you are scheduling you can choose to mute all participants when they enter a meeting or allow them to join a meeting before you.</p><p> Once you’re done adjusting the meeting’s settings you should click on the Save button and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add the meeting to your Google, Outlook or Yahoo calendar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/schedule-zoom-meetings-my-meetings.jpg"                      alt="Scheduled  Zoom Meeting"                ></p><p> You can then copy the invitation to the meeting and send it to the participants via email.

Tap on the <strong>Schedule</strong> button after you launch the Zoom app and proceed to adjust the meeting settings the same way you would on a web portal or desktop client version of this video conferencing platform.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/schedule-zoom-meeting-android.jpg"                      alt="Schedule Zoom Meeting on Android"                ></p><p> Keep in mind that some options are not going to be available if they are disabled or locked on your account or in a group in which you are creating a meeting. Once you’ve adjusted the video and audio options, set the time and date of a meeting or enabled the Add to Calendar feature you can tap on the Done button to complete the setup process.</p><h2 id="How-to-Schedule-Recurring-Meetings"><a href="#How-to-Schedule-Recurring-Meetings" class="headerlink" title="How to Schedule Recurring Meetings?"></a>How to Schedule Recurring Meetings?</h2><p> Zoom allows all of its users to schedule recurring meetings from the web portal, desktop client or the mobile app. All you have to do is click on the checkbox next to the <strong>Recurring Meeting</strong> option while scheduling a new meeting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-recurring-meeting-settings.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Recurring Meeting Settings"                ></p><p> Once the Recurring Meeting feature is enabled you can proceed to choose the recurrence frequency, specify how often the meeting is going to be repeated and set the expiry date. The number of occurrences is limited to fifty, but you can select the No Fixed Time setting if you want your meeting to occur more than fifty times.</p><p> Moreover, hosts of recurring meetings that require registration must choose if they want to allow attendees to register once to attend all occurrences, register for each occurrence they attend or register once and pick the occurrences they want to attend.</p><p> Click on the Save button to confirm the changes you’ve made and then click on the Schedule button to complete the process of creating a recurring meeting. Hosts of Zoom meetings can add, edit or delete occurrences after a recurring meeting is created, although meetings that are added to a calendar service must be edited through the calendar service to which they were added.</p><p> Head over to the Meetings tab, click on the recurring meeting you would like to edit and then locate the Show All Occurrences option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recurring-zoom-meetings-list.jpg"                      alt="Scheduled Zoom Meetings List"                ></p><p> The list of all occurrences is going to appear on your screen and you should click on Edit or Delete options, depending on what you want to do.
