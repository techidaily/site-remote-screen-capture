The good news is that you can share your screen and presentation without formal participation in the Google Meet session. The procedure is slightly different from the regular one. Let’s know more about how to share the screen on Google Meet without joining the meeting.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Open-up-Google-Meet-Invite-Link-and-join-in-the-meeting"><a href="#Step-1-Open-up-Google-Meet-Invite-Link-and-join-in-the-meeting" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Open up Google Meet Invite Link and join in the meeting"></a>Step 1: Open up Google Meet Invite Link and join in the meeting</h3><p>Launch the Google Meet website or its application, enter the meeting code or link, or click <strong>start a meeting</strong>.</p><p>Click the Google Meet invite link and then you will see the screen as below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/present-without-participant-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="  Share Screen without join in Google Meet  "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084396/18498" target="_top" id="2084396"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084396"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="700"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084396/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-2-Share-screen-without-participating"><a href="#Step-2-Share-screen-without-participating" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Share screen without participating"></a>Step 2: Share screen without participating</h3><p>Tap <strong>Present</strong> and select a preferred window to share. By default, the system audio is disabled. Enable it if you need to share the system audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-screen-on-google-meet-without-participating.jpg"                      alt="  Share Screen without join in Google Meet  "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4612444&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-728x90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Note</strong>: When you are just sharing the screen with the microphone and camera disabled, other participants will not be able to hear your voice or see you. Similarly, you do not need to turn on the camera and microphone if you are using Google Meet on an Android device, as you can directly share the screen instead of joining a meeting on an Android device.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Share-Your-Screen-Using-a-Browser-Other-than-Chrome"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Share-Your-Screen-Using-a-Browser-Other-than-Chrome" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Share Your Screen Using a Browser Other than Chrome"></a>Bonus: How to Share Your Screen Using a Browser Other than Chrome</h2><p>Chrome is not the only way to access video-conferencing tools. There is no exception for Google Meet. So, you can use all its features, and even access it through any other browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. Alongside joining Google Meet, you may also share your screen in Firefox and Internet explorer. Similarly, Opera mini can be used as well to take advantage of the screen sharing feature. Although the process is almost the same as in Google Chrome, users may find a slightly different interface when joining through other browsers. Let’s summarize the procedure in simple steps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ancheer.sjv.io/c/5597632/1657301/17326" target="_top" id="1657301"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1657301"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="933"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657301/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-1-Download-the-preferred-browser"><a href="#Step-1-Download-the-preferred-browser" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Download the preferred browser"></a>Step 1: Download the preferred browser</h3><p>Download and launch the browser by clicking on its icon on the desktop or toolbar</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/2044747/22993" target="_top" id="2044747"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-2044747"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2044747/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-2-Open-Google-Meet"><a href="#Step-2-Open-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Open Google Meet"></a>Step 2: Open Google Meet</h3><p>Search for Google Meet and click <strong>new meeting</strong>.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Log in to your Gmail account first**.** You can also directly access Google Meet by entering its official web address.

Understand that, Valheim is a highly prominent Norse-themed game that is filled with monsters. However, the Valheim seeds are vital for everybody, including the hermits and the speedrunners. More so, Valheim is regarded as a Viking survival simulator. As a player of Valheim, you will be dropped in a mythological Norse world with nothing but your clothes and a request from the mighty Odin. The request states that you should conquer all the forsaken monstrous beasts roaming the lands. Though it seems easy, it gets tricky as you begin to explore the tenth Norse world. As you explore, you will notice that your food resources are getting scarce. While you may be thinking of how to get food, you can grow some crops. In Valheim, you can turn almost all areas into farmlands. Before you delve into planting Valheim seeds, you will need to choose the world you want to begin your adventure. Note that you will be exploring various biomes to get materials and food to survive. The aim is to be the best Viking in this purgatory-looking world.</p><p>This is done easily as the Valheim game will ask players to input their Valheim world seeds or leave the game to select anyone for them. The seeds are a series of numbers and letters.

Every world in this game gets a unique seed code for players to move around quickly. With the seed codes, players can keep notes of every saved world that they create.</p><p>Some of the best Valheim seeds include:</p><h3 id="1-Seed-htsE7kJL5K"><a href="#1-Seed-htsE7kJL5K" class="headerlink" title="1.Seed: htsE7kJL5K"></a>1.Seed: htsE7kJL5K</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-1.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-1"                ></p><p>Since you may want your private Island far away from everything you know, this seed is the ideal one to plant. Aside from trying to get far away, the biomes in Valheim are filled with horrible creatures that can appear at your base whenever they like and destroy everything.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is the seed you know for those who want a piece of land free from any monstrous atrocities. You will spawn it on a small island in the middle of the sea. And, the nearest boss here is Eikthyr. With such a seed, your inner Viking can be aligned with you to build a ship and sail further with plans on discovering newer lands.</p><h3 id="2-Seed-HHcLC5acQt"><a href="#2-Seed-HHcLC5acQt" class="headerlink" title="2.Seed: HHcLC5acQt"></a>2.Seed: HHcLC5acQt</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-2.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>It is regarded as the ideal seed for the speedrunners in Valheim. Players in this world seed can spawn within a starter island with roughly four runes, close by traders and nearby bosses. The biomes here are in a distinct starter continent, plus the fifth boss can be likened to be as close as a raft that skips away. This seed is the perfect realm for the players that want to speedrun their game. While this world comes with four bosses, Haldor is on the Island as well. More so, players will find the fifth boss on a neighboring island.</p><h3 id="3-Seed-0V5BZHkqY4"><a href="#3-Seed-0V5BZHkqY4" class="headerlink" title="3.Seed: 0V5BZHkqY4"></a>3.Seed: 0V5BZHkqY4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-3.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4691139&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/SU-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Software Update Pro - Check and update software installed on your computer. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Even if you think that you are the best in Valheim, you will need to learn how to build a ship to sail and discover materials and biomes. If you never knew, sailing does have a learning curve. First of all, you will need to get the necessary ingredients to make a vessel; then, the next thing is to learn the difference between the three boat types available and how to use the wind on your side.</p><p> <em>“Note: the boat types are Karve, longship, and raft. ”</em></p><p>While in the water, it is advisable to look out for horrifying serpents that dwell in the ocean.

To help the amateur players, developers of Valheim added a unique yet rare structure to the game.</p><p>This structure is known as Maypole. It is furniture that is made available only to some Valheim world seeds. The players themselves cannot craft these Valheim seeds.</p><p>With the seed mapoleplz, you will be capable of spawning in a world that has Maypole lying towards the west.

Understand that, Valheim is a highly prominent Norse-themed game that is filled with monsters. However, the Valheim seeds are vital for everybody, including the hermits and the speedrunners. More so, Valheim is regarded as a Viking survival simulator. As a player of Valheim, you will be dropped in a mythological Norse world with nothing but your clothes and a request from the mighty Odin. The request states that you should conquer all the forsaken monstrous beasts roaming the lands. Though it seems easy, it gets tricky as you begin to explore the tenth Norse world. As you explore, you will notice that your food resources are getting scarce. While you may be thinking of how to get food, you can grow some crops. In Valheim, you can turn almost all areas into farmlands. Before you delve into planting Valheim seeds, you will need to choose the world you want to begin your adventure. Note that you will be exploring various biomes to get materials and food to survive. The aim is to be the best Viking in this purgatory-looking world.</p><p>This is done easily as the Valheim game will ask players to input their Valheim world seeds or leave the game to select anyone for them. The seeds are a series of numbers and letters. And, they build a generated world that comes with biomes, resources, and, not to forget, enemies.</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a

Screen recordings are not immune to background noises and for that reason, anyone using screen capturing software should do everything in their power to ensure that the environment in which they are recording a video is as quiet as it possibly can be.</p><p>Creating perfect conditions for audio recording is often hard, due to unforeseen events that can happen while the screen recording session is in progress. Most modern screen recording and video editing computer programs provide features that enable their users to reduce noise levels in their videos significantly. In this article, we are going to provide our readers with a few different methods of reducing or removing noise from their videos.</p><ul><li><a href="#reducenoisefree">Part 1: How to Reduce Audio Noise in a Video Recording For Free</a></li><li><a href="#reducenoisefilmorascrn">A better way to Reduce Audio Noise in a Video Recording with One-click</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Reduce-Audio-Noise-in-a-Video-Recording-For-Free-with-Audacity"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Reduce-Audio-Noise-in-a-Video-Recording-For-Free-with-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Reduce Audio Noise in a Video Recording For Free with Audacity"></a>Part 1: How to Reduce Audio Noise in a Video Recording For Free with Audacity</h2><p>It can hardly be stressed enough how important it is to be prepared for the post-production process, because during the time you spend in the editing room you’ll realize that if you are missing something which may seem trivial, like a room tone recording can prove to be crucial for the success of your video making endeavor.</p><p>A <strong>room tone</strong> is an audio recording of the atmospheric sounds of the room in which you recorded the video. It is frequently used as a baseline for the soundtrack of an entire video since it can help the software remove the unwanted noises from the video’s original audio file. Room tone recordings become even more important if you already know that you’ll have to deal with background noises during the video editing process.</p><p>Besides the room tone recording, you will also need some audio editing software, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" >Audacity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>if you want to remove or at least reduce the levels of audio noise. However, you can only use this software to work with audio files.</p><p>In order to start removing background noises from an audio file, you first need to import the file into Audacity and place it on the software’s timeline. Afterward, you should place the room tone recording to the timeline as well, and then select the silent part of the recording. Once you’ve selected the portion of the room tone recording you’d like to use, find the <strong>Effects</strong> menu, and select the <strong>Noise Reduction</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/noise-reduction-with-audacity.jpg"                      alt="Noise Reductioin"                ></p><p>In the next step, you should click on the <strong>Get Noise Profile</strong> feature, and proceed to deselect the room tone audio file on the timeline. Go back to the Noise Reduction option, and click play to preview the changes you’ve made. If you are not happy with the results, you can adjust the sliders until you are perfectly happy with the sound file you created.</p><h2 id="Part-2-A-Better-Way-to-Remove-Background-Audio-Noise-With-One-Click-After-Recording"><a href="#Part-2-A-Better-Way-to-Remove-Background-Audio-Noise-With-One-Click-After-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A Better Way to Remove Background Audio Noise With One-Click After Recording"></a>Part 2: A Better Way to Remove Background Audio Noise With One-Click After Recording</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-editing-panel.jpg"                      alt="Filmora audio editing "                ></p><p>Audacity doesn’t offer any video editing features and you can only use to edit audio files. Removing background audio noises after recording with a software program like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a better option since it enables you to edit audio and video files in the same project.</p><p>Import the video file into Filmora video editor and place the file on the timeline. Select the audio file and head over to the Audio menu on the left side of the screen. Make sure that the Enable checkbox, in the Denoise menu is marked and then proceed to select Weak, Mid or Strong value. You can play the video and hear if the background noises have been removed. If the audio track has too much noise, you can use the Mute option or you can detach the audio file from the video file and delete it. That’s how easy it is to remove background noises with Wondershare Filmora.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora X Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora X Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Regardless of the type of video you are creating, having crystal clear audio is equally important as producing sharp, high-resolution videos. Video clips that have a great soundtrack are more likely to be a success on social media, which is why you should do everything in your power to create videos that don’t contain any of the unpleasant noises you might have accidentally captured during a screen recording session.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Best Screencastify Alternatives</h2><p>Although the Screencastify extension is a great tool with a dozen of export configurations and editing tools, its usage is limited to the Google Chrome web browser and if you are using any other application for surfing on the internet, then this application is pretty much useless to you.</p><p>However, if you need a screen recorder or a video editing application, then the following are some of the best ones available out there.</p><h3 id="1-Screencast-O-Matic"><a href="#1-Screencast-O-Matic" class="headerlink" title="1. Screencast-O-Matic"></a>1. Screencast-O-Matic</h3><p>The first application that we are discussing is called Screencast-O-Matic and is one of the best alternatives available for Screencastify.

This application comes with almost all the features same as Screencastify and has additional tools for webcam support with the recorded screen videos. With Screencast-O-Matic, you will be able to install and record your screen without leaving the comfort of your browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screencast-o-matic.jpg"                      alt="screencast-o-matic"                ></p><p>It is a complete package of tools that helps its users create stunning videos for effective communication.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Enjoy-Your-Old-Favorites-Top-5-PS1-Game-Simulators-on-PC"><a href="#Enjoy-Your-Old-Favorites-Top-5-PS1-Game-Simulators-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy Your Old Favorites: Top 5 PS1 Game Simulators on PC"></a>Enjoy Your Old Favorites: Top 5 PS1 Game Simulators on PC</h2><p>Sony released its first standalone console for video games, Playstation1 (nicknamed PS1), in 2001. The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo’s SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.</p><p>With the PS1 emulator for PC, you can play PlayStation 1 games. Play your favorite PlayStation games on your computer with the original BIOS, your own BIOS, and your own games. Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better. All you need is a copy of the disc image.</p><h3 id="1-RetroArch-Emulator"><a href="#1-RetroArch-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="1.RetroArch Emulator"></a>1.RetroArch Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/retroarch-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="retroarch-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>This emulator offers a variety of solutions and is just an emulator for playing PS1 video games, making it one of the best ps 1 emulators and most complete emulators. The first stable version was released in the year 2020, almost a decade after its launch in the year 2010. On top of all that, it is free, open-source, and can emulate gaming consoles, media players, game engines, and others. That makes it a very reliable emulator.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Multiple platforms are supported, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li><li>As a fast, portable, lightweight emulator, RetroArch requires no adjustments or very little tweaking to run and function properly.</li><li>In terms of game-saving, refresh rate, game loading, and screen resolution, it is one of the best PS1 emulators out there.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Matsu-Emulator"><a href="#2-Matsu-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="2.Matsu Emulator"></a>2.Matsu Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/matsu-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="matsu-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>There is also the Matsu Emulator, which is based on the PSX&#x2F;PSOne platform. Despite being one of the best emulators in the world, it is also quite stable and safe. There are more and more features being added to the software. In contrast, the simulator works well but the free version has heavy advertising. If you purchase the pro edition in the game, you will be able to remove the advertisements. If you would like to pay someone for an emulator, we would recommend ePSXe or FPse. You will find Matsu Emulator to be a reliable and efficient program if you can endure its commercials.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>It features an on-screen virtual keypad as well as support for gamepads.</li><li>The sound quality is excellent.</li><li>As well as fast-forwarding, it also supports rewinding.</li><li>Up to 16 slots can be used by the Matsu emulator.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Mednafen"><a href="#3-Mednafen" class="headerlink" title="3.Mednafen"></a>3.Mednafen</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mednafen-poster-ps1.png"                      alt="mednafen-poster-ps1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713324&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVTV1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV TV Webcaster</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Games are run using OpenGL and SDL in Mednafen, a multi-system emulator. Users can remap hotkeys and virtual system inputs to joysticks or keyboards, or both simultaneously. Rewinding in real-time and saving at multiple states are supported by the emulator. It also allows you to take screenshots instantly. Pictures are saved as PNG files.</p><p>The majority of Mednafen’s cores are portions from other applications, but some are originals. In terms of quality, precision, and compatibility, its original cores (built to run PS1, Sega Saturn, and Nintendo Virtual Boy games) are noteworthy. The command-line interface of Mednafen is easy to use. Additionally, it supports several third-party GUIs to make configuration even easier. For example, MedLaunch offers a dynamic games library with DAT lookup and online scraping and the ability to configure controllers.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Multi-platform emulation allows games to be played on PlayStation One as well as other gaming consoles.</li><li>Compatible with most gaming consoles, including the PlayStation One, it is very accurate in its compatibility.</li><li>Providing you have the right PlayStation BIOS and ROM, it can be set up quickly and easily.</li><li>The Mednafen emulator supports the use of game cheats.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4535075&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/GU-500_672.png"                      border="0"                >Glary Utilities PRO -  Premium all-in-one utility to clean, speed up, maintain and protect your PC</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-ePSXe"><a href="#4-ePSXe" class="headerlink" title="4.ePSXe"></a>4.ePSXe</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/epsxe-ps1-poster.png"                      alt="epsxe-ps1-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599951&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="864" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVnfr5HudQw" title="The Latest and Easiest Solution to Remove Kindle DRM on Windows (without Degrading)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>Epubor Ultimate for Win：Helps you read books anywhere, including the best eBook Converter + eBook DRM Removal functions.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>You can play PlayStation games on your Android phone and PC using ePSXe (short for enhanced PSX emulator). A wide range of devices are supported, making it a fast, accurate, and highly versatile tool. Within seconds, you can start playing games after configuring the program.

The controller has an excellent battery life, very accurate analog sticks, and large buttons more substantial than those on the Switch joy cons. Especially if you’ve been using an Xbox 360 controller for a while and are ready to upgrade, it’s an excellent choice for your next PC controller.</p><p>Utilizing the Nintendo Switch Pro controller for most of your PC games is a breeze thanks to Steam’s controller configurator, which officially supports this controller. Plug-and-play is the most accurate description. To play games, not on Steam, you need to use this guide.</p><p>This article will tell you how to enable your Nintendo Switch Pro controller to work with Steam or Windows, either through a Bluetooth connection or a wired connection. The first thing you’ll need is a Nintendo Switch Pro controller (obviously) and a USB-C cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-pro-controller-poster.jpg"                      alt="switch-pro-controller-poster"                ></p><hr><p><strong>You might be interested in:</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top Best Nintendo Switch Emulators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Record Nintendo Switch Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Wired-Connection-for-Switch-Pro-Controllers"><a href="#Wired-Connection-for-Switch-Pro-Controllers" class="headerlink" title="Wired Connection for Switch Pro Controllers"></a><strong>Wired Connection for Switch Pro Controllers</strong></h2><p>Windows describe it as a DirectInput controller instead of an XInput controller, so getting it to work with PC games can prove tedious. However, thanks to Value-adding full Switch controller support to Steam, you will probably be able to play most of your favorite games.</p><p><strong>Step1:</strong> Connect the Pro Controller cable (or any USB-A-to-USB-C cable) to your PC. If your computer has a USB-C port, connect the USB-C-to-USB-C data cable instead.</p><p><strong>Step2:</strong> Connect the other end of the cable to your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-pro-controller-connected-with-cable.jpg"                      alt="switch-pro-controller-connected-with-cable"                ></p><p>There you have it!

You will find plenty of them out there for switch pro controllers.</p><p><strong>Solution2:</strong> The second method is to use a software-based XInput Wrapper.

In September 2021, PlayStation showcased a packed trailer with Daddy Kratos, foes along the Atreus. The trailer has been trending since the time it was released. Even the first look of the trailer is serving us with too much suspense. The addition of new characters, game details, and plot everything is so on point. Want to know more! Let’s jump to the further details.</p><h2 id="God-of-war-Ragnarok-Release-Date"><a href="#God-of-war-Ragnarok-Release-Date" class="headerlink" title="God of war Ragnarok: Release Date"></a><strong>God of war Ragnarok: Release Date</strong></h2><p>Desperate to know about the God of war Ragnarok Release Date! You reading this is clear proof that you are waiting for this fantastic addition to gameplay. PlayStation studios and Sony Santa announced that Release Date is now shifted from 2021 to 2022. Maybe it’s not a huge surprise for you, but the gameplay is worth waiting for</p><h2 id="God-of-war-Ragnarok-Story"><a href="#God-of-war-Ragnarok-Story" class="headerlink" title="God of war Ragnarok: Story"></a><strong>God of war Ragnarok: Story</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/god-of-war-ragnarok-poster2.jpg"                      alt="god-of-war-ragnarok-poster2"                ></p><p>Now when you are aware from the God of war Ragnarok Release Date, have a look to the storyline. After watching the trailer of God of war Ragnarok, our expectations are pretty high. The game is the ninth entry within the sequel of 2018’s jaw-dropping God of war. God of war was all about ancient Greece to Scandinavia, Kratos against the monsters, and Gods of Norse Mythology. The trailer gave us the idea to expect a more confident and older Atreus, and the next story is going to be based on his giant genes.</p><p>Now, the father and son are the new face of Ragnarok, the Norse version of disaster. Their new journey will be about facing the old enemies from God of War, Freya. New enemies include Thor and Kratos with his son’s rebellious nature. His son is the only one with knowledge about Atreus. The overall story will be based on a total of Nine Realms. Before this, God of War took place in six realms. The latest realms will be Asgard, Svartalfheim, and Vanaheim, along with the previous ones.</p><p>Furthermore, the trailer clarifies that we will see some new characters like Angrboa, who will be one of the last giants in the gameplay. Have you noticed a big guy in the trailer? He is Tyr, the son of Odin and half-brother of Baldur and Thor. But, the son is imprisoned by the father, isn’t it an incredible thrill? If you focus more on the PS5 showcase, you will realize it’s a brief and cryptic teaser. The overall trailer revolves more around the arrival of Ragnarok. In the excitement of “Ragnarok is coming,” most of us are not noticing the game footage. For us, it’s a confirmation of suspense. That background warning of Kratos is not less than an alarm for Atreus and viewers that we should “get ready.” At the end of God of War, we noticed that Kratos’s wife was another mystery; she was the Giant Laufey. This clearly shows that Atreus is Half God and as well as Half-Giant. He has a different name, i.e., Loki. Yes, Loki, the trickster of the Norse Mythology.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/god-of-war-ragnarok-poster3.jpg"                      alt="god-of-war-ragnarok-poster3"                ></p><p>Now, we expect that Ragnarok will explore Faye’s past and the reason she kept it secret. Hopefully, Atreus will get the shape-changing abilities that Loki is currently notorious for. So, Atreus is not just going to be about standing on the sidelines and firing arrows at enemies.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537546&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/7_copy_2_2_hdpro.png"                      border="0"                >HD Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="God-of-War-Ragnarok-is-not-PS5-exclusive"><a href="#God-of-War-Ragnarok-is-not-PS5-exclusive" class="headerlink" title="God of War Ragnarok is not PS5 exclusive"></a><strong>God of War Ragnarok is not PS5 exclusive</strong></h2><p>Along with the God of war Ragnarok Release Date, there is news that the game will not be a PS5 exclusive.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Comparing-Recording-Quality-The-Pros-Cons-of-30Fps-and-60Fps"><a href="#Comparing-Recording-Quality-The-Pros-Cons-of-30Fps-and-60Fps" class="headerlink" title="Comparing Recording Quality: The Pros &amp; Cons of 30Fps and 60Fps"></a>Comparing Recording Quality: The Pros &amp; Cons of 30Fps and 60Fps</h2><p>You probably didn’t anticipate coming across so many technical terms when you first started recording videos. You only wanted to make quality content you know your audience will enjoy. Now you are hearing phrases like frame rate being tossed around, leaving you a bit intimidated.</p><p>After all, you want your videos to be the best they can ever be, don’t you? Plenty of thought and consideration goes into making a high-quality video for YouTube or any other social media platform where your audience will watch it. Therefore, educating yourself and applying the knowledge accordingly would be wise.</p><p>Keep reading this article to learn more about FPS in video recording and how to choose the best frame rate.</p><h2 id="Overview-of-FPS-in-Video-Recording"><a href="#Overview-of-FPS-in-Video-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Overview of FPS in Video Recording"></a>Overview of FPS in Video Recording</h2><p>A video works very similarly to a flipbook, which contains a series of still images. When you view these images at a certain speed, the animation unfolds, giving the illusion that the images are moving. Each image is known as a frame, and the frame rate is the speed at which the frames move. Frame rate is usually expressed as “frames per second,” or FPS in short.</p><p>If a video is set to play at 24fps, it means there are 24 frames in every second the video plays. Technology is very nifty and can trick your brain into the idea that animation flows smoothly. However, if the video were slowed down, you would notice that the motion is not as smooth as it seems. This smooth motion enables you to enjoy the video without hiccups or disruptions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-recording-fps.jpg"                      alt="fps in video recording"                ></p><p>In addition to influencing your audience’s viewing experience, the frame rate also affects how realistic you want your video to be. An FPS of 24 is ideal for movies because the motion is similar to how we see the world.</p><p>On the other hand, sporting events and video games require a higher frame rate to accommodate all the events happening simultaneously. The high frame rate also keeps the details crisp and ensures the motion is as smooth as possible. You wouldn’t want to watch a football match where the motion cuts every three minutes.</p><p>A lower FPS is ideal if you want to blur the video or use techniques like slow motion in the video. You could also opt for a lower FPS if you’re creating animated GIFs. Remember, you can’t make your GIF too large. Therefore, you would rather sacrifice detail and fluid motion and choose a low frame rate with a smaller size.</p><h2 id="What-Is-a-Good-FPS-for-Recording-a-Video"><a href="#What-Is-a-Good-FPS-for-Recording-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Good FPS for Recording a Video?"></a>What Is a Good FPS for Recording a Video?</h2><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a rule set in stone that will guide you in choosing a frame rate. In fact, there has been a lot of controversy surrounding which frame rate will give your audience the best viewing experience. Research won’t yield the answers you are looking for since there are points to support just about any frame rate you google.</p><p>The simple fact is that different FPS will yield different results, meaning there is no perfect frame rate. The option you choose for your videos will depend on your unique needs and the type of content you want to create. However, there are a few factors you need to consider before you pick the best fps to record video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/factors-for-choosing-recording-video-fps.jpg"                      alt="factors for choosing fps in video recording"                ></p><h4 id="Motion"><a href="#Motion" class="headerlink" title="Motion"></a>Motion</h4><p>If your video contains a lot of movement, it would be wise to stick to a higher frame rate to keep the motion crisp. We also urge you to capture the video at a higher frame rate for increased editing flexibility.</p><h4 id="Realism"><a href="#Realism" class="headerlink" title="Realism"></a>Realism</h4><p>Even though movies are fictitious, the concept should be tied to how we naturally see the world. For instance, when a person throws a ball, we see a bit of blur as the object moves in the air. Therefore, the frame rate you choose should mimic this motion blur and make your video more realistic.</p><h4 id="Delivery"><a href="#Delivery" class="headerlink" title="Delivery"></a>Delivery</h4><p>You can be lax about the frame rate if you want to deliver the video on the Internet because the viewers are a bit forgiving. However, we urge you to stick to 24fps if you project a movie in the theatre to give it a cinematic look. On the other hand, the best frame rate for recording video for TV would be between 24 to 30fps.</p><h3 id="File-size-and-export-time"><a href="#File-size-and-export-time" class="headerlink" title="File size and export time"></a>File size and export time</h3><p>Last but not least, it would be wise to consider the ideal file size for your video and how long it will take to export it. A higher frame rate means more still images are packed into one second of the video. The file size automatically increases, and you will notice that it takes longer to export your videos to platforms like YouTube or Vimeo.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="30-Vs-60-FPS-Video-Recording-–-Which-Is-Better"><a href="#30-Vs-60-FPS-Video-Recording-–-Which-Is-Better" class="headerlink" title="30 Vs. 60 FPS Video Recording – Which Is Better?"></a>30 Vs. 60 FPS Video Recording – Which Is Better?</h2><p>By now, you understand that 30fps means that 30 still images are packed into one second of the video. The same principle applies to 60fps. You will see 30 fps in soap operas, television, and live broadcasts. The shots in this frame rate are more detailed, even though they give the video an unrealistic feel because that isn’t how we naturally view the world.</p><p>On the other hand, 60fps is commonly used in fast-paced videos where you need enough frames to accommodate the action and enjoy the video. However, more filmmakers and directors are incorporating 60 fps in their videos to make the motion look smooth. Have you ever wondered how a slow-motion scene looks so crisp even when the camera zooms in on the actor? A 60-fps frame rate is the answer!</p><p>The debate still continues and people continue to compare 30 vs 60 fps video recording. As we mentioned earlier, there is no ideal fps recording. It all depends on what you want to do with your video.</p><p>For instance, if you want a slow-motion scene with little to no motion blur, then you are better off choosing 60 FPS. You could also choose a higher frame rate when shooting at concerts where a lot is happening at once.</p><p>However, smoothness is not always the best. You are better off sticking to realistic shots for movies or TV shows because that is what day-to-day life looks like. Therefore, 30 FPS is the best choice. An even lower frame rate would work if you want your movie to have a jittery feel or you want to insert a comedic feel into your content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/30-60-fps-video-recording.jpg"                      alt="30 vs 60 fps video recording"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.textstudio.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35633309&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/d6eb8222c9718486bdabce8b897380f7/products/3_premium-icon.png"                      border="0"                > Take advantage of PREMIUM features for 12 months.<br>Create your texts &#x2F; logos without any limitation.<br>No attribution required when downloading.<br>No advertising on the website.<br> TextStudio.com  PREMIUM - Yearly Membership</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-a-Higher-FPS-Better-for-Video-Recording"><a href="#Is-a-Higher-FPS-Better-for-Video-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Is a Higher FPS Better for Video Recording?"></a>Is a Higher FPS Better for Video Recording?</h2><p>It wouldn’t be a great idea to jump into choosing a high frame rate for your video without understanding what it means or how it will affect the viewing experience.</p><p>Remember, a higher frame rate is not always the best fps for recording video. It might also do more harm than good and leave your video in shambles. You wouldn’t want to go back to the drawing board because you jumped on the bandwagon of choosing a high fps for the sake of it.</p><p>We urge you to do your homework and find out which frame rate works best for the content you want to create. A high fps recording also means your file will be bigger and take longer than usual to export.</p><p>A higher FPS isn’t the ideal choice if you are not willing to deal with a large file size. Another crucial factor to consider would be the viewing experience for your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152810&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/842ca578342915ccb8ae069595ba7233/products/copy_bootit-ss1_178x139.jpg"                      border="0"                >The BootIt Collection covers multi-booting, partitioning, and disk imaging on traditional PC’s using the standard BIOS and  newer PC’s using UEFI.   The collection includes BootIt Bare Metal (BIBM) for standard BIOS systems and BootIt UEFI (BIU) for UEFI system.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-To-Record-Your-Screens-at-Different-FPS"><a href="#How-To-Record-Your-Screens-at-Different-FPS" class="headerlink" title="How To Record Your Screens at Different FPS?"></a>How To Record Your Screens at Different FPS?</h2><p>Developers have been working tirelessly to create apps to help content creators and filmmakers like yourself record and edit their videos.

The star of the most-followed channel on Twitch makes more than $560,000 a month streaming. If you are looking to get in on the action you need to pick up the best gaming <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >webcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your budget. However, there is a lot to consider before choosing your camera.</p><p>This guide critiques and ranks the best gaming webcams to make that choice easier. Some webcams provide great value, while others deliver an unbelievable high-resolution streaming experience. The following are some of the features we looked for in creating this guide:</p><h2 id="What-to-Look-for-in-Gaming-Webcams"><a href="#What-to-Look-for-in-Gaming-Webcams" class="headerlink" title="What to Look for in Gaming Webcams"></a>What to Look for in Gaming Webcams</h2><ul><li>Video quality</li><li>Resolution</li><li>Microphone quality</li><li>Price</li><li>Low-light capabilities</li></ul><h2 id="Our-Ideal-Gaming-Webcam-Would-Have"><a href="#Our-Ideal-Gaming-Webcam-Would-Have" class="headerlink" title="Our Ideal Gaming Webcam Would Have"></a>Our Ideal Gaming Webcam Would Have</h2><ul><li>1080p resolution</li><li>60FPS</li><li>Stereo Audio</li><li>Ergonomic design</li><li>RealSense capabilities</li><li>Automatic light correction</li><li>Compatibility with both Windows and Mac</li></ul><p>So, without further ado, the following are our 5 favorite webcams for gaming in 2021:</p><h4 id="1-Ontop-HD-Webcam"><a href="#1-Ontop-HD-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="1. Ontop+ HD Webcam"></a>1. Ontop+ HD Webcam</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ontop-webcam.jpg"                      alt="Ontop Webcam "                ></p><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Microphones-Facial-enhancement-Technology-Recording-Streaming/dp/B074D2K7CZ" >Ontop+ HD Webcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a fantastic entry-level camera. It has a <strong>6-element glass lens</strong> and delivers <strong>1080p at an admirable 30 FPS</strong>. It also has <strong>automatic low-light correction</strong>, which is so important to us! The result is precise and dependable streaming quality, without the need for an expensive lighting setup.</p><p>Working with OBS Studio, the Ontop+ is designed to optimise your videos for YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The wide-angle view also gives you impressive <strong>80-degree panoramic views</strong>.</p><p>Now, it is often assumed that audio is something which lets even the most expensive webcams down. Ontop+ wanted to challenge this assumption and make a webcam with fantastic audio quality. With <strong>built-in dual digital noise-cancellation microphones</strong>, Ontop+ claim their camera will work in all environments. Unfortunately, they haven’t quite lived up to the hype and the audio is occasionally patchy. But, at just under $50 we are willing to overlook some of the Ontop+’s limitations to give it our seal of approval.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Wide-angle viewing lens</li><li>Optimised for YouTube and Twitch</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>Average Amazon rating</li></ul><h4 id="2-Logitech-BRIO"><a href="#2-Logitech-BRIO" class="headerlink" title="2.

Logitech BRIO</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitech-brio-4k-webcam.jpg"                      alt="Logitech Brio 4K Webcam "                ></p><p>The Logitech BRIO is the best high-end webcam for streaming. It delivers tremendous <strong>4K Ultra HD recording</strong>, allowing streamers to produce professional-quality videos. The BRIO is capable of shooting in 3,840 x 2,160 at 30 FPS (Ultra HD), 1,920 x 1,080 at 30 or 60 FPS (Full HD) and 1,280 x 720 at 30 or 60 FPS (HD).</p><p>The BRIO is also packed with additional features such as <strong>5x digital zoom</strong>, <strong>facial recognition</strong> and <strong>omnidirectional mics</strong>. It also supports <strong>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</strong> which gives it exceptional performance regardless of the light conditions. Plus, you can choose between a 65-degree, 78-degree, and a 90-degree field of vision, privacy shade and a flexible mount.</p><p>For professional streamers, this is a fantastic investment piece. However, there is a catch. To stream at 4K, you’ll need to connect the Brio to a USB 3.0 port on a computer running on Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processors.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>4K Ultra HD recording</li><li>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</li><li>Fantastic audio</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>Compatibility</li></ul><h4 id="3-Razer-Kiyo"><a href="#3-Razer-Kiyo" class="headerlink" title="3.

The <strong>ring-light camera</strong> is a new feature, with twelve white LED lights surrounding the lens. Plus, the Razer Kiyo lets you adjust the brightness of the ring-light camera, with <strong>12 different brightness settings,</strong> so that you can always get the most flattering light. Although the Kiyo doesn’t come with much else. There’s no facial enhancement technology or background replacement.</p><p>What it does excel at is creating a vivid stream with high resolution. It is capable of shooting <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD)</strong> like a lot of its competitors. But we are convinced gamers will love the great lighting features that are unique to this style of streaming webcam. The camera was created after consultation with Twitch streamers and it also comes with built-in support for Xsplit and Open Broadcaster Software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Built-in Ring Light</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Built for Twitch streamers</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>No additional features</li><li>Cost</li></ul><h4 id="4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam"><a href="#4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="4.

With <strong>1080p full HD video at 30 FPS</strong>, on a <strong>2-megapixel base</strong> and <strong>built-in stereo microphones</strong>, this webcam keeps up with its main competitors and delivers a high-resolution image.</p><p>What we love about it though is its ease of use. This camera is compatible with Windows XP, Mac OS 10.6 and Android 5.0 or higher. It has <strong>no additional software to install</strong>, just plug it into a USB port and start streaming. It is also very portable and light.</p><p>Although, the lighting might be an issue unless you have a good ambience when you stream. The Aukey also does not autofocus as well as other cameras on this list. But with a discount on Amazon, this is an excellent camera for beginners.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Cost</li><li>Ease of use</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>No lighting correction features</li><li>No 60 FPS streaming</li></ul><h4 id="5-Razer-Stargazer"><a href="#5-Razer-Stargazer" class="headerlink" title="5. Razer Stargazer"></a>5. Razer Stargazer</h4><p>The Razer Stargazer is the best webcam at effortless background removal. It is the only external webcam with an <strong>Intel RealSense 3D camera</strong>, state of the art depth-sensing technology allows you to give more viewing space to the game and gives your viewers a more engaging experience.</p><p>However, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/intel-realsense-guide,news-20286.html?_ga=2.47407079.1755955212.1524468879-954383139.1524153897" >Intel RealSense camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> limits the camera’s compatibility to Windows 10 computers with sixth-generation or later Intel Core CPUs. This is a minimum specification that non-RealSense webcams don’t require.</p><p>Like most of its competitors the Stargazer streams <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD).</strong> With the Stargazer, you will have good screen resolution, but you will not be the sharpest-looking streamer on platforms like Twitch. Occasionally, the Kiyo will struggle to focus in low-light settings, but it does have <strong>fantastic colour accuracy</strong>. What it does have over its competitors though is audio. The Stargazer wins out here because it’s <strong>fantastic at filtering out ambient noise</strong>.</p><p>If you don’t have the room or money for a physical green screen or an external mic but want effortless and professional performance the Razer Stargazer is the webcam for you, with prices starting at <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Stargazer-Depth-Sensing-Webcam-1080P/dp/B01GE9QM5M" >only $150 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Incredible background removal technology</li><li>Great audio</li><li>Cost</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Not as good video quality as some of its competitors</li><li>Not compatible with older generation computers</li></ul><p>Streamers on platforms such as Twitch, seem to be choosing Logitech cameras most often. However, although the BRIO delivers unbeatable performance for gaming, there are now other brands challenging Logitech’s gaming supremacy. Razer has two innovative cameras on this list. The Kiyo has cutting-edge lighting technology and the Stargazer, with Intel RealSense, has the best background removal technology we have seen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Project-Manager-3D-Models-4-800x800.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082529/7443" target="_top" id="2082529"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082529"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>For those with the budget to invest in a serious piece of equipment, we would recommend the BRIO and the Stargazer, depending upon your computer’s processor.
