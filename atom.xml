Top keyboard makers are constantly pushing the boundaries of speed, design, material, and functionality. High pricing is inevitable as a result of this competitiveness. But don’t be concerned! So you don’t have to break the bank, we’ve compiled a list of the best gaming keyboard under 100$. This article is ideal for individuals on a budget who are searching for high-quality mechanical boards.</p><p>We evaluated many choices, starting at $36, and tested the many types of keyboard that delivered excellent value for money — somewhat unexpectedly, the cheapest option was the one we wouldn’t suggest. A new gaming keyboard may make a significant impact if you are starting to work from home or just playing more PC games than you did a few months ago.</p><p>Getting the proper gaming keyboard, like getting the proper gaming mouse, comes down to personal preference — from comfortability (wrist rest) about whether you would like RGB Lights, mechanical buttons, tactile feedback, configurable keys, separate media keys, or a slew of other features we can’t begin to list. Also, check out our dictionary of keyboard terminology to help you narrow down your design choices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.macxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4526659&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.macxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/vcp-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO"><a href="#1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO" class="headerlink" title="1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO"></a>1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro.jpg"                      alt="corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro"                ></p><p>The Corsair K55 RGB PRO XT is the best gaming keyboard for under 100$ with non-mechanical buttons. It features rubber dome buttons, unlike most of the other keyboards on this list. They’re a little heavier to push than traditional mechanical keyboards, and they don’t provide the same haptic feedback, and they’re still light enough to satisfy gamers.</p><p>It’s jam-packed with gaming features, including the ability to assign macros to any key and six additional macro keys just on the left side. It features complete RGB illumination and individually illuminated keys, which you can configure using the iCUE software, available for Windows and macOS. The latency is also quite minimal, which is fantastic. The keyboard includes one inclination setting and wrist rest.

We can say Logitech’s G413 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$. Despite its low price, it is well-made, with a plastic body and a strong metal top half so that you will have no problems with it.</p><p>Only patented Romer-G Tactile switches are included, which feature a short pre-travel distance and provide excellent tactile feedback without being too heavy to write on.

It’s an excellent gaming keyboard featuring a few extra functions to enhance your gaming experience. It’s full-size, with a sturdy frame and superior quality finishing, but still, ABS keycaps aren’t as comfortable as PBT.</p><p>It comes with vertical Kailh Speed Silver and Kailh clicky Speed Bronze keys, both of which we tried, and it’s hot-swappable so that you can use anything you like. Our unit’s clicky ones feature a short pre-travel range and low operational force, making them easy to push for gaming. The delay is also quite common, thus there should be no noticeable lag when gaming. The EVGA Release RGB software allows you to remap all keys, but it isn’t as user-friendly as other rival manufacturers’ software.</p><h5 id="Pros-3"><a href="#Pros-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Keyboard is best suited to gaming.</p><p>It’s a straightforward keyboard with excellent ergonomics and comfy wrist rest.</p><h5 id="Cons-3"><a href="#Cons-3" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The keys are too touchy for typing.</p><p>Keys can be noisy in a noisy setting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958374/18409" target="_top" id="1958374"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958374"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958374/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Corsair-K63"><a href="#5-Corsair-K63" class="headerlink" title="5.Corsair K63"></a>5.Corsair K63</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-k63.jpg"                      alt="corsair-k63"                ></p><p>Corsair K63 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$ with the wireless link we’ve tested. This mechanical TenKeyLess variant may connect to up to 2 different devices at the same time, either through the USB receiver or over Bluetooth. The ergonomics are excellent since it’s a horizontal keyboard with just one inclination option. However, the wrist rest looks cheap.</p><p>Only linear MX Red Cherry keys are available, which take little effort to activate and provide no tactile feedback. Although the pre-travel length is somewhat greater than that of comparable gaming keyboards, the switches are still extremely sensitive and should not cause fatigue. You can reprogram or assign macros to any key, and it has some additional features like dedicated media buttons and a Windows lockout that stops you from inadvertently minimizing your game.</p><h5 id="Pros-4"><a href="#Pros-4" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>The quality and reliability are just adequate since the frame is composed of cheap-feeling plastic.</p><h5 id="Cons-4"><a href="#Cons-4" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The illumination is limited to single blue color.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42570605&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/usbXcopy/Nero_USB_x_copy_Screen_2.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><p>The Corsair K55 RGB PRO XT is the best gaming keyboard for under 100$ with non-mechanical buttons.

The EVGA Release RGB software allows you to remap all keys, but it isn’t as user-friendly as other rival manufacturers’ software.</p><h5 id="Pros-18"><a href="#Pros-18" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Keyboard is best suited to gaming.</p><p>It’s a straightforward keyboard with excellent ergonomics and comfy wrist rest.</p><h5 id="Cons-18"><a href="#Cons-18" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The keys are too touchy for typing.</p><p>Keys can be noisy in a noisy setting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Corsair-K63-3"><a href="#5-Corsair-K63-3" class="headerlink" title="5.Corsair K63"></a>5.Corsair K63</h3><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006123/18460" target="_top" id="2006123"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006123"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006123/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-k63.jpg"                      alt="corsair-k63"                ></p><p>Corsair K63 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$ with the wireless link we’ve tested. This mechanical TenKeyLess variant may connect to up to 2 different devices at the same time, either through the USB receiver or over Bluetooth. The ergonomics are excellent since it’s a horizontal keyboard with just one inclination option. However, the wrist rest looks cheap.</p><p>Only linear MX Red Cherry keys are available, which take little effort to activate and provide no tactile feedback. Although the pre-travel length is somewhat greater than that of comparable gaming keyboards, the switches are still extremely sensitive and should not cause fatigue. You can reprogram or assign macros to any key, and it has some additional features like dedicated media buttons and a Windows lockout that stops you from inadvertently minimizing your game.</p><h5

Zoom allows its users to purchase webinar add-ons that can have as many as 149 hosts and 10,000 attendees. Each of the plans enables the host or hosts to have an unlimited number of meetings, which means that you can run as many webinars as you want with Zoom.</p><p>The platform doesn’t allow its users to host webinars for free and you must purchase a monthly or the annual subscription if you would like to host your webinars on Zoom. You can choose from Pro, Business, Education and Zoom Room options and the exact cost of the subscription depends on the maximum number of hosts and participants a webinar can have, so, for instance, you will have to pay around $50 per month if your webinar plan has just one host and a hundred participants.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-webinar-on-zoom-pricing.jpg"                      alt="Add Webinar to Zoom Plan"                ></p><p>Furthermore, each of the available plans offers the cloud recording option, and you can get up to 3 TB of extra storage for an additional fee. Once you purchase a license you will also have to assign it to the owner of the Zoom account or the admin of a particular account. You can do this by heading over to the User Management menu and selecting the Users option. After you locate the user to which you would like to assign a webinar license, you should click on the Edit button at the end of the user’s row and click on the Webinar option in the Feature menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-webinar-setting-editing.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Webinar Setting Editing"                ></p><p>Optionally, you can choose the user’s role, specify their job title or add their location. When done, you should click on the Save button to confirm the changes you’ve made and proceed with the setup of your webinar.</p><p>Looking for some other webinar software?

Keep in mind that a single webinar cannot occur more than fifty sessions.</p><p>In addition, you can adjust the registration settings, audio options, set up a webinar password, enable practice sessions or opt to record the webinar automatically.</p><p>Zoom also enables you to add templates to the webinar you’re scheduling, pick the webinar’s time zone or use Q&amp;A panels during throughout the webinar. The webinar’s host can allow only signed-in users to join the webinar or make the webinar on-demand. However, only webinars that require registration can be turned into on-demand webinars, and by enabling this option you will automatically activate the cloud recording feature.</p><p>Hosts can choose to turn off their video streams while setting up a new webinar, but video streams can be switched on at any point during a webinar. Moreover, you can choose if you want to switch the participants’ videos on or off, although you should only use this option if you are sure that you won’t be needing attendees’ videos throughout the webinar.</p><p>Click on the Schedule button when done adjusting the webinar settings and proceed to send invitations to panelists or attendees.</p><p>Panelists have a different status than attendees since they can view and send videos, share their screens or add annotations. Attendees, on the other hand, can only view the webinar, but the host can unmute them or change their view of the webinar. In most cases, attendees interact with a webinar through Q&amp;A panels and chat.</p><p>The process of inviting panelists to a webinar is straightforward since you just have to go to the Invitations tab and click on the Edit button in the Panelists section.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254549&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/8_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/invite-people-to-zoom-webinar.jpg"                      alt="Invite people to Zoom Webinar"                ></p><p>Zoom allows you to invite up to a hundred panelists to a webinar, and you just have to add their names and emails to the corresponding boxes and click on the checkbox next to the Send invitation to all newly added panelists immediately option.</p><p>Click on the Save button to send invitations to panelists.

The webinar is a paid add-on that is available on Pro, Business and other Zoom’s subscription models. The meeting feature, on the other hand, is available on free and all other versions of the Zoom platform.</p><p>Furthermore, all participants in a Zoom meeting can share their screens, see other participants or speak to them. Webinar attendees, cannot share their screens, use annotations or any other options provided by the platform, as their interaction capabilities are reduced to chat and participation in Q&amp;A panels. In addition, the host of a webinar can choose whether or not he or she wants to see the video of each attendee, while all attendees join webinars in a listen-only mode.</p><p>A webinar can have up to 10,000 participants, while meeting cannot have more than a thousand participants. Furthermore, Zoom meetings are primarily used for business purposes like sales or customer-facing meetings. Education is the most common reason for creating a webinar, and unlike meetings, Zoom webinars can have up to fifty sessions. Consequently, the list of features Zoom meetings and Zoom webinars offer are slightly different.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Anyone can set up a new webinar with Zoom, even if they have no previous experience. However, knowing how long each session of the webinar is going to last or how much time should pass between two webinar sessions is going to help you adjust the settings of your webinar more precisely.

On this box, you can also check the <strong>Automatically join audio by computer when joining a meeting</strong> box at the bottom to automatically use the computer’s sound device for audio output and input every time you host or participate in a meeting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296855&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/recode/Nero_Recode_Screen_2.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-join.jpg"                      alt="Join Zoom Meeting "                ></p><p>Once you are in a conference, there are a couple of things you can do to manage the audio.

These might be due to unmanaged positioning of the hardware devices, improper configurations of the <strong>Zoom audio settings</strong>, or both. Some of the most common Zoom audio problems and their possible solutions are discussed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-audio-advanced-settings.jpg"                      alt=" Zoom Meeting Settings Advanced Audio Settings "                ></p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-1-Audio-Feedback-Loop"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-1-Audio-Feedback-Loop" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 1: Audio Feedback Loop"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 1: Audio Feedback Loop</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It"><a href="#What-Is-It" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p>Audio feedback loop is when your voice keeps repeating itself for an indefinite number of times and never stops whatsoever.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >6 Top Voice Changer for Zoom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h5 id="How-It-Happens"><a href="#How-It-Happens" class="headerlink" title="How It Happens?"></a>How It Happens?</h5><p>When you are using external speakers and microphone, and both are placed nearby, any sound that comes out of the speaker is received by the microphone. If Zoom is configured to accept sounds from system audio, the mic sends the signals back to the speakers that again send the audio output to the mic. Since this iteration never ends, you continuously hear an audio feedback loop.</p><h5 id="How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?"></a>How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>In order to eliminate this issue, make sure to place both microphone and speakers at a safe distance from each other. This would prevent the microphone from receiving any output from the speakers, and the chain of audio feedback loop would never take place.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-1"><a href="#What-Is-It-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p>Background noise is the distortion or humming that you hear during an audio call on zoom.</p><h5 id="Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?"></a>Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>If you have a highly sensitive microphone that is mostly used by professionals or in recording studios, the chances are that it will catch a lot of background noise during a Zoom meeting.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?</h5><p>This issue can be resolved by either hosting or joining a meeting in a closed, soundproof room, or using a less sensitive mic. It would be best if you use a normal headset that is easily available in any local electronic shop. You can also try enabling the <strong>Automatically adjust volume</strong> option from the <strong>Microphone</strong> section of the <strong>Audio</strong> category of the <strong>Settings</strong> box as explained earlier in <strong>Step 3</strong> of the <strong>Zoom Audio Settings When Not in Meeting</strong> section.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-2"><a href="#What-Is-It-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p><strong>Zoom audio echo</strong> is when you hear an echo sound during an ongoing Zoom meeting with audio enabled.</p><h5 id="How-It-Happens-1"><a href="#How-It-Happens-1" class="headerlink" title="How It Happens?"></a>How It Happens?</h5><p>Echo happens when you are on a laptop and are using onboard speakers and microphone, and that too with the speaker or mic volume set to maximum.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?</h5><p>As mentioned earlier, it is always advisable to use a headset to avoid any such unwanted echo or audio feedback loop issues. In case you don’t have access to a headset, try configuring the microphone settings to automatically adjust the volume, and not putting the speaker volume to the max.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Configuring <strong>Zoom audio settings</strong> before hosting or joining a meeting is always a wise approach to avoid any audio inconsistencies during an ongoing conference. However, if you are already in one, you can use the methods given above to configure the microphone settings to get the audio right. You are also encouraged to use an average quality headset during a Zoom meeting to avoid any <strong>Zoom audio echo</strong>, feedback loop, or background noises.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Improve Video Quality in Zoom Meetings?

In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4.

However, if you have added a small mod, it might not support Boss Checklist because it depends upon the permission provided by each mod to Boss Checklist to access the progress.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>Keep record of everything you do</li><li>Check what you have accomplished</li><li>Check what you have to accomplish</li><li>Keep record of every boss you kill</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="Filmora-Best-Game-Video-Recorder-and-Editor"><a href="#Filmora-Best-Game-Video-Recorder-and-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Filmora - Best Game Video Recorder and Editor"></a>Filmora - Best Game Video Recorder and Editor</h3><ul><li>Record game videos on your computer with audio and webcam.</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Edit videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> quickly with a wide range of gaming effects.</li><li>Rich video tempaltes and resources for game videos.</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion:"></a><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h4><p>It is fun to play Terraria but the fun and thrill will be doubled by adding the above mods.

This Android OS was released in 2013, and it is the first OS for Android Smartphones that enabled its users to create screen recordings, although only via the Android Developer SDK, with the help of Android Debug Bridge. Furthermore, this option only works if the device is connected to a computer, and you also need to have access to the phone’s Developer mode.</p><p>One year after the KitKat OS was introduced to the public Google developed a new version of the Android OS, popularly named Lolipop, which allowed users to record their Smartphone’s screen with an app. The name Lollipop refers to versions 5.0 and 5.1.1 of the Android OS, and in February 2018, 24,6% of all Android devices accessing Google Play had the Lollipop OS. The more recent versions of Android OS, like Android ‘Marshmallow’, also provide support for screen recording apps.</p><p>If you have Lollipop or Marshmallow OS installed on your Android Smartphone, you can use the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rivulus.screenrecording&hl=en" >Lollipop Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, although plenty more screen recording apps are available on the Google Play. Let’s have a look at the steps you’ll need to take in order to figure out how to record your screen on your Android phone with Lollipop Screen Recorder.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder"></a>Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder</h4><p>Open the Google Play application on your phone and search for the Lollipop Screen Recorder app. You can download it for free, so after the installation of the app is complete, launch it and proceed to adjust the settings for your screen recording session.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings"><a href="#Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings"></a>Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Lollipop Screen Recorder features only three settings, that let you choose whether you want to shoot in Landscape or Portrait mode, change the resolution of the video recording and enable the audio recording feature.</p><p>It is important to pay attention to the size of the file you are producing, especially if you want to send it to someone because if you pick the maximum Recording Resolution, the video file of your screen recording is going to be huge. Tutorials in which you show how an app is used or how to fix a certain problem on an Android Phone can benefit from the Record Microphone Audio option because it will enable you to explain the steps with your voice.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device"><a href="#Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device"></a>Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-start-recording.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Now that you’ve adjusted all the settings for a screen recording session, you should click on the circular icon located in the upper right corner of the app.</p><p>After you tap on the icon a message will pop up on the screen informing you that the app is about to start a new screen recording session. Check the Don’t show again checkbox and proceed to tap on the Start Now button. Once the screen recording session is in progress, you can leave the Lollipop Screen Recorder app and perform all activities you wanted to capture with your Android Smartphone.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session"><a href="#Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session" class="headerlink" title="Step 4  Finishing the recording session"></a>Step 4  Finishing the recording session</h4><p>The app’s notification bar is going to be located at the top of the Smartphone’s screen, during the screen recording session, so in order to stop recording you simply need to find the notification with the label ‘Recording Screen’ and press stop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-recorded-file.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Go back to the Lollipop Screen Recorder and you’ll be able to find the video file in the app’s main window. You can play the video directly from the Lollipop Screen recorder or you can share it to your Gmail account directly from the app. If you don’t like the screen recording you made, you can tap on the Delete button and start a new session.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Amazingly easy to use and it lets you capture videos in Portrait and Landscape modes.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Lollipop Screen Recorder can only capture screens in the device’s native resolution, and it doesn’t provide any customization options.</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Find out more video recorders for Android Phones and Tablets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37540879&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://paperscan.orpalis.com/img/content/You_prefer_to_use.png"                      border="0"                >PaperScan Professional： PaperScan Scanner Software is a powerful TWAIN &amp; WIA scanning application centered on one idea: making document acquisition an unparalleled easy task for anyone.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen"></a>Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen</h2><p>Using an app to record the screen of your Android smartphone is just one method in which this task can be accomplished.

That doesn’t necessarily mean that you can’t record video with older android devices.<br>In such cases you can use android SDK to mirror the device’s display and record it using a desktop screen-capture software. Mirroring Software will enable you to record the screen on an Android device without rooting. You can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-screen-mirror/" >Wondershare MirrorGo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> software to mirror cast the screen from your mobile phone to a display on your computer. Here’s how to record your screen on Android without rooting.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Install-Wondershare-MirrorGo"><a href="#Step-1-Install-Wondershare-MirrorGo" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Install Wondershare MirrorGo"></a>Step 1: Install Wondershare MirrorGo</h4><p>Start the process of setting up your screen recording session by downloading the MirrorGo Android recorder software for free from the manufacturer’s website.

Although they are frequently used to capture the gameplay of a video game, capture cards can also be used to capture a screen on an Android Smartphone.</p><p>These external video adapters let you connect the Android device and a computer, although you’ll have to spend some time to properly set up a screen recording session with a capture card. Some capture cards can cost as much as $200, so if you want to utilize this method to capture a screen on your Android Smartphone you should be prepared to invest money in such a project.</p><p>But the cost is the only downside of this otherwise very effective method of recording a screen on an Android device. The amount of options capture cards offer is staggering, but before you start recording a screen on your Smartphone you must make sure that you have the right hardware and software equipment.</p><p>What if this also doesn’t work for you? Don’t give up. You still stand a chance if your android device has an HDMI port. You can connect your device to a digital video camera and do the recording. Failing this, your solution will depend on a PC with HDMI PCI Express card or a USB HDMI adaptor powered with a suitable video capture software.</p><p>Sometimes you shouldn’t depend on installing apps. With the help of a ROM flasher, you can get a screen recorded included in your devices ROM. Therefore, if you already have a custom ROM running on your device, better to have a look if a screen recorder is installed. If so, it is a matter of activating it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Because of this, it becomes imperative to ensure that anything that the meeting attendees see looks decent and professional. One of the things that most people get conscious about during a video call is the background.</p><p>Many times, the walls of the rooms the organizer and&#x2F;or the invitees are using during the session might not be well-maintained. This is the main reason why everyone using the app must learn <strong>how to blur the background in Teams</strong>.</p><p>With that said, the following sections explain <strong>how to blur the background in Microsoft Teams</strong> on a computer, cellphone, and tablet.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Blur Background on Teams on a Windows Laptop Before or During a Video Call</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Blur Background on Teams on a MacBook Pro Before or During a Video Call</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Blur Background in Teams Mobile App Before or During a Video Call</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs about Blur Teams Meeting Background</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How to Blur Video Background on Teams Recorded Video?</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Blur-Background-on-Teams-on-a-Windows-Laptop-Before-or-During-a-Video-Call"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Blur-Background-on-Teams-on-a-Windows-Laptop-Before-or-During-a-Video-Call" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Blur Background on Teams on a Windows Laptop Before or During a Video Call?"></a>Part 1: How to Blur Background on Teams on a Windows Laptop Before or During a Video Call?</h2><p>Microsoft Teams allows you to blur the background of the webcam footage before you start or join a video call, during an ongoing session. The methods of getting this done on the laptop computers are explained below in detail.</p><p>The following sections explain <strong>how to blur the background on Teams</strong> both before and during a video call while working on a Windows laptop. The step-by-step instructions are given below:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Blur-Background-on-Teams-Before-Video-Call"><a href="#Method-1-Blur-Background-on-Teams-Before-Video-Call" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Blur Background on Teams Before Video Call"></a>Method 1: Blur Background on Teams Before Video Call</h3><p>If you have a meeting scheduled at a particular time but don’t know what to do with that homely background that wouldn’t go with the professional ambiance, luckily Microsoft Teams lets you blur it quite conveniently. The process is described as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Initiate a New Meeting Session</strong></p><p>Launch Microsoft Teams, and make sure that the <strong>Chat</strong> icon is selected in the left pane. From the top of the <strong>Chat</strong> pane, click the <strong>New Meeting</strong> (<strong>Camcorder</strong>) icon, and click <strong>Start meeting</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-teams.jpg"                      alt="Start Microsoft Teams video call on Windows laptop"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Check the Devices</strong></p><p>On the <strong>Meeting with</strong> box, make sure that the <strong>Video</strong> and <strong>Audio</strong> switches present under the preview screen are enabled. Turn them on if they’re disabled. Next, click the <strong>Background effects</strong> (<strong>Person</strong>) icon from under the preview screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microsoft-teams-blur-background-option.jpg"                      alt="  Microsoft Teams background blur"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Blur the Background before video call starts</strong></p><p>From the <strong>Background settings</strong> pane that appears next, and click to select the <strong>Blur</strong> tile. After this, you can safely click the <strong>Join now</strong> button to start a Teams video meeting with the blurred background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-video-background-microsoft-teams.jpg"                      alt="  Microsoft Teams background blur"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> While using other operating systems&#x2F;laptops like Linux, Chromebook, etc., the process of blurring the background before a video call is identical. This means all you need to do is, initiate a new video meeting, click the <strong>Background effects</strong> (<strong>Person</strong>) icon from under the preview screen, and select the <strong>Blur</strong> tile before clicking the <strong>Join now</strong> button.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ancheer.sjv.io/c/5597632/1657301/17326" target="_top" id="1657301"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1657301"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="933"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657301/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-2-Blur-Background-on-Teams-During-Video-Call"><a href="#Method-2-Blur-Background-on-Teams-During-Video-Call" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Blur Background on Teams During Video Call"></a>Method 2: Blur Background on Teams During Video Call</h3><p>If you started or joined a Teams meeting without blurring the background, and want to do so during an ongoing call, you can follow the instructions given below to learn <strong>how to blur background in Teams</strong> while in a virtual conference session:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open the Background settings Pane</strong></p><p>During an ongoing video call, click <strong>More actions</strong> from the upper-right area of the meeting window, and click <strong>Apply background effects</strong> from the menu that comes down.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873313/18544" target="_top" id="1873313"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873313"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1263"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873313/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-background-effects-microsoft-teams.jpg"                      alt="  blur background during Microsoft Teams"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Blur Background during the video call</strong></p><p>When the <strong>Background settings</strong> pane opens on the right of the window, click to select the <strong>Blur</strong> tile.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Save the Changes</strong></p><p>From the bottom of the <strong>Background settings</strong> pane, click <strong>Apply</strong> to blur the background.

You can learn <strong>how to blur the background in Microsoft Teams</strong> while using an iOS device (iPhone X is used here for illustration) by following the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Start a New Meeting</strong></p><p>Launch Microsoft Teams on your iPhone or iPad, ensure that the <strong>Chat</strong> icon is selected from the bottom of the interface, tap the <strong>Instant meeting</strong> (<strong>Camcorder</strong>) icon from the top-right corner of the screen, and tap <strong>Start meeting</strong> from the bottom of the box that appears next.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-teams-iphone.jpg"                      alt="start Microsoft Teams  call on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Get to the Background Effects Screen</strong></p><p>On the next screen, tap to enable both <strong>Video</strong> and <strong>Audio</strong> functions from the bottom, tap the <strong>More actions</strong> icon, and then tap <strong>Background effects</strong> from the box that comes up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microsoft-teams-iphone-background-effects.jpg"                      alt=" blur Microsoft Teams  background on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Blur the Background</strong></p><p>On the <strong>Select background</strong> screen, tap <strong>Blur</strong> from the options available in the box at the bottom, and tap <strong>Done</strong> from the top-right corner to apply the changes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37100474&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://awario.com/images/pages/index/img-platform-ui-1280@1x.avif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-teams-video-call-background-iphone.jpg"                      alt=" blur Microsoft Teams  background on iPhone"                ></p><h2 id="FAQs-about-Blur-Teams-Meeting-Background"><a href="#FAQs-about-Blur-Teams-Meeting-Background" class="headerlink" title="FAQs about Blur Teams Meeting Background"></a>FAQs about Blur Teams Meeting Background</h2><p><strong>Q1) Why can’t I blur my background in Microsoft Teams?</strong></p><p><strong>A1)</strong> If you’re unable to see the ‘Blur’ tile or the ‘Background settings’ option altogether, probably your PC doesn’t have Advanced Vector Extension 2 (AVX2) graphics. While Microsoft is still working to make the ‘Blur’ option enable for all the devices, no official statement from the organization has been released to date.</p><p>On the other hand, if your computer has AVX2 and you still cannot see the option, you can try a couple of things, and see if any of those works for you. For instance, you can:</p><ul><li>Sign out of Teams and then sign back in</li><li>Check for and update the webcam driver</li><li>Check for and install the most updated version of Microsoft Teams</li><li>Restart your computer</li></ul><p><strong>Q2) Can I blur the background in the Teams Business version?</strong></p><p><strong>A2)</strong> Yes, you can. Microsoft Teams (Free), Microsoft 365 Business Basic, and Microsoft 365 Business Standard versions allow you to blur the background with ease.

All you have to do is double-click on the Xbox button and the screenshot will be captured. A sidebar will appear on the screen asking you if you want to take a screenshot or record the last 30 seconds of the gameplay. Just hit the Y button to save the screenshot. A dialog box will appear on the screen informing you that the screenshot has been saved successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-screenshot.jpg"                      alt="Xbox Screenshot "                ></p><p>An increasing number of video games for Xbox One can be played in 4K resolution, but in order to play a game in a 4K resolution, you must have a 4K TV set. Moreover, the 4K and HDR capabilities your TV must be enabled before you start playing an Xbox One game in 4K. Taking a 4K screenshot on Xbox One requires you to adjust the capturing settings.</p><p>Press the Xbox button on the controller, and locate the System menu. Select the Settings option from the System menu and then click on the Preferences submenu. Navigate to the Broadcast&amp;Capture option and when the new menu appears on the screen, click on the Game clip resolution and select one of the available 4K settings.</p><p>Keep in mind that 4K screenshots are significantly larger in size than those in HD or any other resolution so if you would like to share a screenshot on social media you’ll first have to download it to your Windows 10 PC and resize it.

Both of them enable you to take screenshots using voice commands. If your Xbox One has the Kinect motion sensor, you should issue the ‘Xbox take a screenshot’ command. Viewing the screenshot immediately after it was taken, requires you to say ‘Xbox open that’ and the screenshot will pop up on the screen or you can just push and hold the Xbox button on the controller.</p><p>You can say ‘ Hey <em>Cortana, take a screenshot’</em> if your Xbox One features a Cortana motion sensor. However, in order to be able to issue voice commands, you must first activate this option. Head over to the Xbox One’s Settings menu and locate the All Settings option. Click on System and switch on the AI Companion feature.</p><p>It is important to say the command clearly so the AI can understand what you are trying to do, and for that reason, you should try to avoid capturing screenshots or recording videos via voice commands in noisy rooms.</p><h2 id="How-to-Manage-and-Share-Screenshots-on-Xbox-One"><a href="#How-to-Manage-and-Share-Screenshots-on-Xbox-One" class="headerlink" title="How to Manage and Share Screenshots on Xbox One?"></a>How to Manage and Share Screenshots on Xbox One?</h2><p>Capturing screenshots of the epic moments in an Xbox One video game and sharing those images with your friends is equally simple.
