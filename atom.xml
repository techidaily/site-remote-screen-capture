Use Mobizen Screen Recorder with Internal Audio App to Record the internal audio on Android</h3><p>Recently, RSUPPORT company developed the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rsupport.mvagent" >Mobizen Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app that is equipped with all the essential screen recording tools. At the same time, it also allows its users to record only sound produced by their Smartphones during the screen recording session. You can download this app for free on the Google Play store, but if you choose to install it on your Android phone, you should arm yourself with patience since this app contains ads.</p><p>After you’ve successfully installed Mobizen Screen Recorder on your Android Smartphone, you should launch the app and look for the Settings gear icon located in the upper right corner of your screen. Tap on the Sound option, and before proceeding any further, you should make sure that Sound is enabled. Once you allow the Sound feature, you’ll be able to see the Options menu that offers External and Internal features. By selecting the Internal option, you will instruct the app to record only the sound produced by the gameplay of the video game you are recording or a YouTube video you’re playing while the screen recording session is in progress.</p><p>The result you will get is the crystal clear audio in your screen recording, but Mobizen app performs well <strong>only with Samsung and LG Android phones</strong>, so if you have an Android device from some other manufacturer, this app may underperform.</p><h3 id="2-Record-the-internal-audio-from-a-microphone-on-Android-with-the-AZ-Screen-Recorder-2"><a href="#2-Record-the-internal-audio-from-a-microphone-on-Android-with-the-AZ-Screen-Recorder-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the internal audio from a microphone on Android with the AZ Screen Recorder"></a>2. Record the internal audio from a microphone on Android with the AZ Screen Recorder</h3><p>If you choose to utilize this method of recording internal audio, make sure that the room where your recording is completely silent since the microphone you will be using can pick up external sounds as well as internal audio.</p><p>You can download the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en" >AZ Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the Google Play for free. Once the installation is complete, launch the app and tap on the Settings icon. This app won’t record sound until you enable this option, which is the reason why you should locate the Record Audio feature in the Settings menu.</p><p>At this point, you should exit the app, and click on the AZ bubble on the side of your Smartphone’s screen. Tap on the Record icon to start the screen recording session and proceed to perform all actions you wanted to capture with your Android device. The audio will be recorded simultaneously with the video. When ready, slide down the notification bar, and stop the screen recording session.</p><p>In order to extract the audio file, you’ll have to transfer the screen recording you made with AZ Screen Recorder to a PC and perform this action with a video editing software. You may have to create several screen recordings of your Smartphone’s screen before you get the perfect audio because the device’s microphone is going to capture all sound it can pick up, both external and internal.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Record-Android-internal-audio-with-a-capture-card-2"><a href="#Part-2-Record-Android-internal-audio-with-a-capture-card-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card"></a>Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card</h2><p>Capture cards are much more than screen recorders since they mostly serve as a bridge between a PC and the device whose screen you are trying to capture.

While in this article, I will show you 4 different ways in the following 3 Parts to record your gameplay video with internal audio recording on Android phones or tablets without root.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Record system internal audio with Android screen recording apps</a></li><li><a href="#part1">Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card</a></li><li><a href="#part1">Part 3: Record Android Internal Audio with Bandicam and the Nox Emulator</a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Record-system-internal-audio-with-Android-screen-recording-apps-3"><a href="#Part-1-Record-system-internal-audio-with-Android-screen-recording-apps-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Record system internal audio with Android screen recording apps"></a>Part 1: Record system internal audio with Android screen recording apps</h2><p>For a long time, the only way to record the internal audio with an Android Smartphone was through the device’s external microphone. This method of recording audio had many downsides, including poor audio quality and capturing of distracting background noises.</p><p>There are several different ways in which you can record system audio and avoid producing screen recordings with terrible sound. Each of the methods includes using third-party apps or screen capturing devices, since Android Lollipop and later versions of the Android OS, still don’t offer an effective solution to this problem.</p><h3 id="1-Use-Mobizen-Screen-Recorder-with-Internal-Audio-App-to-Record-the-internal-audio-on-Android-3"><a href="#1-Use-Mobizen-Screen-Recorder-with-Internal-Audio-App-to-Record-the-internal-audio-on-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Mobizen Screen Recorder with Internal Audio App to Record the internal audio on Android"></a>1. Use Mobizen Screen Recorder with Internal Audio App to Record the internal audio on Android</h3><p>Recently, RSUPPORT company developed the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rsupport.mvagent" >Mobizen Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app that is equipped with all the essential screen recording tools. At the same time, it also allows its users to record only sound produced by their Smartphones during the screen recording session. You can download this app for free on the Google Play store, but if you choose to install it on your Android phone, you should arm yourself with patience since this app contains ads.</p><p>After you’ve successfully installed Mobizen Screen Recorder on your Android Smartphone, you should launch the app and look for the Settings gear icon located in the upper right corner of your screen. Tap on the Sound option, and before proceeding any further, you should make sure that Sound is enabled. Once you allow the Sound feature, you’ll be able to see the Options menu that offers External and Internal features. By selecting the Internal option, you will instruct the app to record only the sound produced by the gameplay of the video game you are recording or a YouTube video you’re playing while the screen recording session is in progress.</p><p>The result you will get is the crystal clear audio in your screen recording, but Mobizen app performs well <strong>only with Samsung and LG Android phones</strong>, so if you have an Android device from some other manufacturer, this app may underperform.</p><h3 id="2-Record-the-internal-audio-from-a-microphone-on-Android-with-the-AZ-Screen-Recorder-3"><a href="#2-Record-the-internal-audio-from-a-microphone-on-Android-with-the-AZ-Screen-Recorder-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the internal audio from a microphone on Android with the AZ Screen Recorder"></a>2. Record the internal audio from a microphone on Android with the AZ Screen Recorder</h3><p>If you choose to utilize this method of recording internal audio, make sure that the room where your recording is completely silent since the microphone you will be using can pick up external sounds as well as internal audio.</p><p>You can download the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en" >AZ Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the Google Play for free. Once the installation is complete, launch the app and tap on the Settings icon. This app won’t record sound until you enable this option, which is the reason why you should locate the Record Audio feature in the Settings menu.</p><p>At this point, you should exit the app, and click on the AZ bubble on the side of your Smartphone’s screen. Tap on the Record icon to start the screen recording session and proceed to perform all actions you wanted to capture with your Android device. The audio will be recorded simultaneously with the video. When ready, slide down the notification bar, and stop the screen recording session.</p><p>In order to extract the audio file, you’ll have to transfer the screen recording you made with AZ Screen Recorder to a PC and perform this action with a video editing software. You may have to create several screen recordings of your Smartphone’s screen before you get the perfect audio because the device’s microphone is going to capture all sound it can pick up, both external and internal.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Record-Android-internal-audio-with-a-capture-card-3"><a href="#Part-2-Record-Android-internal-audio-with-a-capture-card-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card"></a>Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card</h2><p>Capture cards are much more than screen recorders since they mostly serve as a bridge between a PC and the device whose screen you are trying to capture. Professionals often use capture cards, despite their prices, simply because they enable them to record high-quality screen recordings, create live streams, and record internal audio from any device they are connected to, including Android Smartphones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-capture-card.jpg"                      alt="Record Android games on PC with capture card"                ></p><p>Most capture cards are equipped with their own screen recording software, so the process of adjusting the video and audio settings depends on the capture card you have. If you have an <a class="link"   href="https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/downloads" >Elgato <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Capture Card you can have complete control over the audio recording process by using the Elgato Sound Capture feature. This powerful tool will enable you to mix sounds from multiple sources, select which microphones will be used during a live stream and adjust the music and sound volumes. However, if you want to use the Elgato, you need to make sure that your PC is compatible with this capture card, and you’ll have to connect your Android Smartphone with this device.</p><p>Using capture cards to record a screen on your Smartphone may be too expensive since capture cards are frequently used as a part of the professional gaming equipment used for streaming or capturing gameplay from games on Xbox or PS4.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Record-Android-Internal-Audio-with-Bandicam-and-the-Nox-Emulator-3"><a href="#Part-3-Record-Android-Internal-Audio-with-Bandicam-and-the-Nox-Emulator-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Record Android Internal Audio with Bandicam and the Nox Emulator"></a>Part 3: Record Android Internal Audio with Bandicam and the Nox Emulator</h2><p>Although this may not be the simplest way to record internal audio on your Smartphone device, it is probably the best solution if you want to create high-resolution screen recordings of your Smartphone’s screen and professional internal audio recordings at the same time.</p><p>Before you can start a recording session you must first install <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Bandicam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your PC. This software can be used for the production of high-quality screen recordings of your desktop, and it also offers excellent audio recording options.</p><p>Furthermore, you are going to need an Android emulator, an app that sends the pictures from your Android’s screen to a bigger screen, connected to your Android device. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.bignox.com/" >Nox App Player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will enable you to run the apps you want to record on your PC. There is a recording feature in the NOxPlayer Emulator, while the Bandicam software can be used to capture your desktop activities, as well as the system audio during a screen recording session. So, it is recommended to use both Bandicam and NoxPlayer to record audio in the video from Android phone on PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-android-games-pc-noxplayer.jpg"                      alt="Record Android games on PC"                ></p><p>This method of recording internal audio on an Android device is best used if you want to create high-resolution audio recordings that can later be edited and used in the final cut of the screen recording you produced with Bandicam software and the Nox App Player.</p><p>That’s the way that we figured out about how to record the internal sound on your Android phones and tablets.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Open-World-Alternatives-to-Grand-Theft-Adventure"><a href="#Open-World-Alternatives-to-Grand-Theft-Adventure" class="headerlink" title="Open World Alternatives to Grand Theft Adventure"></a>Open World Alternatives to Grand Theft Adventure</h2><p>Understandably, you may be looking for other games like GTA if you’ve enjoyed being in Los Santos and Blaine County, but find that things are getting stale. Despite Rockstar’s continued tease of GTA 6, most of us have already experienced that world since 2013. We’ve collected a few of our favorite GTA-inspired substitutes for you to enjoy in the meantime. We’ve compiled 10 games like GTA V to keep you occupied until we find out what’s next for the series.</p><h3 id="1-Red-Dead-Redemption-2"><a href="#1-Red-Dead-Redemption-2" class="headerlink" title="1.Red Dead Redemption 2"></a>1.Red Dead Redemption 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/red-dead-redemption-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="red-dead-redemption-2-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>The same studio makes both the GTA series and Red Dead, so you can probably guess why that one’s here. As with its predecessor, Red Dead Redemption 2 has an open world that feels alive, and it never says away from including interesting details. Following an outlaw gang who hopes to pull one last heist before retiring, it is primarily a story of trust and betrayal. The story is not as simple as it seems, and many unexpected twists and turns are revealed. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a great game if you like GTA 5 with a Wild West theme and revolver weapons. Its setting is reminiscent of GTA’s belief in player freedom. If you’re in the mood for a Grand Theft Auto experience, Red Dead Redemption 2 is well worth your time.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Visuals and voice acting is incredible.</p><p>• Side quests and main missions that will thrill you.</p><p>• Many side distractions that are both ludicrous and delightful.</p><p>• You feel like you have gone back a century.</p><h3 id="2-Assassin’s-Creed-Origins"><a href="#2-Assassin’s-Creed-Origins" class="headerlink" title="2.Assassin’s Creed Origins"></a>2.Assassin’s Creed Origins</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/assassins-creed-origins-poster.jpg"                      alt="assassins-creed-origins-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, Google Stadia</p><p>The Assassin’s Creed series has increasingly emphasized open-world gameplay, making it a great choice for GTA 5 fans. You’ll find plenty of fun to be had with its vast world that is three times larger than Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. There are dungeons and pyramids to explore so that you won’t get bored.</p><p>As well as this, it has a great story that offers a refreshing change of pace from the assassin-focused theme of the original series. In some historical accuracy, Aya and Bayek, who collaborate with Cleopatra to become the first assassins, are depicted by Assassin’s Creed Origins. Even though Origins does not have a modern theme like GTA 5, it still offers excellent graphics and gameplay that will keep fans entertained.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Visually stunning and the soundtrack matches it.</p><p>• The world has gone mad.</p><p>• Combat is outstanding.</p><p>• The best part of the Assassin’s Creed History.</p><h3 id="3-Watch-Dogs-2"><a href="#3-Watch-Dogs-2" class="headerlink" title="3.Watch Dogs 2"></a>3.Watch Dogs 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/watchdogs-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="watchdogs-2-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms</strong>: PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>Ubisoft took this criticism to heart when developing Watch Dogs 2, which was criticized as a sour-hearted affair. In this regard, Rockstar’s new game straddles a much closer line between contemporary Grand Theft Auto games and its own setting for a biting satire. From Grand Theft Auto 5, do you remember the mission “Life Invaders”? It’s pretty cool to use bungee-corded pool balls as weapons. This is essentially what Watch Dogs 2 is like, but blown up into an entire game. Despite Watch Dogs 2’s parody of Silicon Valley, Rockstar’s still packs a punch that Ubisoft’s doesn’t, but anyone who has ever had to watch an Apple conference or a Facebook ad will laugh no end.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• An entertaining and strong mission design.</p><p>• There is a lot to see and do in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>• Hack into any electronic device.</p><p>• The concept is very similar to GTA V but it is more of a tech genre game.</p><h3 id="4-Saints-Row-The-Third"><a href="#4-Saints-Row-The-Third" class="headerlink" title="4.Saints Row: The Third"></a>4.Saints Row: The Third</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/saintsrow-the-third-poster.png"                      alt="saintsrow-the-third-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016170/19272" target="_top" id="2016170">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016170" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016170/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox One, Switch, PS3, Xbox 360</p><p>Initially, Saints Row was an obvious ripoff of GTA, desperately trying to copy Rockstar’s style. In the end, it was a mediocre effort that garnered a cult following for two games but failed to make a lasting impression. Saints Row: The Third, in contrast, took note of how grim and serious games like GTA were becoming, said “f that,” and made them ridiculous.</p><p>You play as a group of friends so widely known and loved that you rob a bank dressed as novelty costumes of yourselves. Players will face a small-scale zombie apocalypse, make various decisions that matter, and fight with a three-foot-long dildo bat as a melee weapon. Many GTA-like games get stuck in their own self-importance, but Saints Row just stays as silly as possible. Although this is an older game, it has backward compatibility on Xbox One and was ported to Nintendo Switch in 2019, so it is a great excuse to revisit the Saints once again.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Activities that are absurd and surreal.</p><p>• Plot twists that will make your head spin.</p><p>• The world has a tremendous amount of depth.</p><p>• Driving and combat models that are simple.</p><h3 id="5-Just-Cause-4"><a href="#5-Just-Cause-4" class="headerlink" title="5.Just Cause 4"></a>5.Just Cause 4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/just-cause4-poster.jpg"                      alt="just-cause4-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>You, the player, have a lot of freedom in Just Cause 4, so you can achieve unprecedented levels of chaos.

Although the dynamics of these games will be different compared to GTA 5, you will enjoy the gameplay.</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>The same studio makes both the GTA series and Red Dead, so you can probably guess why that one’s here. As with its predecessor, Red Dead Redemption 2 has an open world that feels alive, and it never says away from including interesting details. Following an outlaw gang who hopes to pull one last heist before retiring, it is primarily a story of trust and betrayal. The story is not as simple as it seems, and many unexpected twists and turns are revealed. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a great game if you like GTA 5 with a Wild West theme and revolver weapons. Its setting is reminiscent of GTA’s belief in player freedom. If you’re in the mood for a Grand Theft Auto experience, Red Dead Redemption 2 is well worth your time.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Visuals and voice acting is incredible.</p><p>• Side quests and main missions that will thrill you.</p><p>• Many side distractions that are both ludicrous and delightful.</p><p>• You feel like you have gone back a century.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1484963">                    <video width="864" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484963">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1484963.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1484963%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484963/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Assassin’s-Creed-Origins-1"><a href="#2-Assassin’s-Creed-Origins-1" class="headerlink" title="2.Assassin’s Creed Origins"></a>2.Assassin’s Creed Origins</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/assassins-creed-origins-poster.jpg"                      alt="assassins-creed-origins-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, Google Stadia</p><p>The Assassin’s Creed series has increasingly emphasized open-world gameplay, making it a great choice for GTA 5 fans.

In this regard, Rockstar’s new game straddles a much closer line between contemporary Grand Theft Auto games and its own setting for a biting satire. From Grand Theft Auto 5, do you remember the mission “Life Invaders”? It’s pretty cool to use bungee-corded pool balls as weapons. This is essentially what Watch Dogs 2 is like, but blown up into an entire game.

In the end, it was a mediocre effort that garnered a cult following for two games but failed to make a lasting impression. Saints Row: The Third, in contrast, took note of how grim and serious games like GTA were becoming, said “f that,” and made them ridiculous.</p><p>You play as a group of friends so widely known and loved that you rob a bank dressed as novelty costumes of yourselves. Players will face a small-scale zombie apocalypse, make various decisions that matter, and fight with a three-foot-long dildo bat as a melee weapon. Many GTA-like games get stuck in their own self-importance, but Saints Row just stays as silly as possible. Although this is an older game, it has backward compatibility on Xbox One and was ported to Nintendo Switch in 2019, so it is a great excuse to revisit the Saints once again.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Activities that are absurd and surreal.</p><p>• Plot twists that will make your head spin.</p><p>• The world has a tremendous amount of depth.</p><p>• Driving and combat models that are simple.</p><h3 id="5-Just-Cause-4-1"><a href="#5-Just-Cause-4-1" class="headerlink" title="5.Just Cause 4"></a>5.Just Cause 4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/just-cause4-poster.jpg"                      alt="just-cause4-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>You, the player, have a lot of freedom in Just Cause 4, so you can achieve unprecedented levels of chaos.

The design philosophy of Yakuza 0 is taken to its logical conclusion. Yakuza 0 joins the likes of Grand Theft Auto 5 with karaoke, pool, arcade games, wrestling, bowling, dancing, gambling, and… I think awkwardly viewing some explicit material in the back of a video store. Those last two can attest that not all side activities are tastefully done, but the sheer number and variety of options are astonishing. Compared to GTA, Yakuza has a much smaller scope, but what it lacks in quantity (quirky, offbeat) it makes up for in quality.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• It’s so diverse.</p><p>• Funny writing that is snappy and genuinely funny.</p><p>• There are some great sidequests.</p><p>• The storyline and main characters are good.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094477/7443" target="_top" id="2094477">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094477" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094477/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Sleeping-Dogs-2"><a href="#7-Sleeping-Dogs-2" class="headerlink" title="7.Sleeping Dogs"></a>7.Sleeping Dogs</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sleeping-dogs-poster.jpg"                      alt="sleeping-dogs-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One, PS3, Xbox 360</p><p>In keeping with its name, Sleeping Dogs was a sleeper hit in 2012.

Unfortunately, Sleeping Dogs 2 was canned while still in its early stages of development, making it a rare gem that deserves to be appreciated for what it brought to the table.

As with its predecessor, Red Dead Redemption 2 has an open world that feels alive, and it never says away from including interesting details.

The story is not as simple as it seems, and many unexpected twists and turns are revealed. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a great game if you like GTA 5 with a Wild West theme and revolver weapons. Its setting is reminiscent of GTA’s belief in player freedom.

In truth, Rockstar’s latest offering lacks the storytelling prowess of its signature franchise but instead excels at choreographing carnage on an epic scale.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• The abilities of Rico are immensely powerful.</p><p>• The setting is beautiful and varied.</p><p>• Extreme weather conditions are the essence of Just Cause.</p><p>• New gadgets can be experimented with on the physics system.</p><h3 id="6-Yakuza-0-3"><a href="#6-Yakuza-0-3" class="headerlink" title="6.Yakuza 0"></a>6.Yakuza 0</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yakuza0-poster.jpg"                      alt="yakuza0-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4</p><p>With so many side activities to enjoy outside of the main campaign, Grand Theft Auto has always been praised for the way it brings cities to life. The design philosophy of Yakuza 0 is taken to its logical conclusion. Yakuza 0 joins the likes of Grand Theft Auto 5 with karaoke, pool, arcade games, wrestling, bowling, dancing, gambling, and… I think awkwardly viewing some explicit material in the back of a video store. Those last two can attest that not all side activities are tastefully done, but the sheer number and variety of options are astonishing. Compared to GTA, Yakuza has a much smaller scope, but what it lacks in quantity (quirky, offbeat) it makes up for in quality.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• It’s so diverse.</p><p>• Funny writing that is snappy and genuinely funny.</p><p>• There are some great sidequests.</p><p>• The storyline and main characters are good.</p><h3 id="7-Sleeping-Dogs-3"><a href="#7-Sleeping-Dogs-3" class="headerlink" title="7.Sleeping Dogs"></a>7.Sleeping Dogs</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sleeping-dogs-poster.jpg"                      alt="sleeping-dogs-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One, PS3, Xbox 360</p><p>In keeping with its name, Sleeping Dogs was a sleeper hit in 2012. Combining the action of B-movie stunt movies with the conventions of the open-world crime genre, it becomes a sleeper hit. With its garb of a classic Bruce Lee film, it feels like Grand Theft Auto dressed up as a classic video game. Unfortunately, Sleeping Dogs 2 was canned while still in its early stages of development, making it a rare gem that deserves to be appreciated for what it brought to the table. Sleeping Dogs was re-released in 2014 on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, so there’s really no excuse to let it remain unpurchased (sorry).</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Fights well drives well and runs well.</p><p>• A well-acted and told story.</p><p>• The game features fierce melee combat, an alluring atmosphere, and fun gunplay.</p><p>• You can find a variety of collectibles and enjoy many other diversions.</p><h3 id="8-The-Saboteur-3"><a href="#8-The-Saboteur-3" class="headerlink" title="8.The Saboteur"></a>8.The Saboteur</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-saboteur-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-saboteur-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Microsoft Windows, iOS, Xbox 360, BlackBerry, PlayStation 3</p><p>Taking the open-world game experience and tying it to a WWII setting makes The Saboteur a great game. With multiple realistic historical elements, it is set during the German occupation in France. Sean Devlin, an Irish cab driver who joins the resistance after the German soldiers kill his best friend, is the protagonist of The Saboteur.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, The Saboteur and GTA 5 have a lot in common. Both involve running around an open world, stealing cars, causing havoc, and evading the law. Gamers will be entertained for hours with The Saboteur’s interesting open-world gameplay and side-quests.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Action that moves quickly.</p><p>• Filter for black and white graphics.</p><p>• There is a vast world to discover in this game.</p><p>• Excellent sound design and a great story.</p><h3 id="9-Mafia-Definitive-Edition-3"><a href="#9-Mafia-Definitive-Edition-3" class="headerlink" title="9.Mafia: Definitive Edition"></a>9.Mafia: Definitive Edition</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mafia-definite-edition-poster.jpg"                      alt="mafia-definite-edition-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows</p><p>While Mafia: Definitive Edition lacks the open-world concept as much as fans would have liked, its mafia-themed story makes up for it. Mafia’s story is similar to GTA 5’s astonishing storytelling ability. Tommy Angelo is a cab driver who becomes involved in the Mafia after an unfortunate event. Fans are kept on edge by Mafia’s story as they experience unexpected betrayal and heartbreaking forgiveness.</p><p>Additionally, Mafia provides a third-person perspective and multiple weapons within the game, similar to GTA 5. There are a lot of similarities between the Mafia franchise and GTA 5.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• This is an excellent story.</p><p>• The artwork for Lost Heaven is stunning.</p><p>• The original story is enhanced by new voice work and facial captures.</p><p>• The visuals are impressive.</p><h3 id="10-Grand-Theft-Auto-IV-3"><a href="#10-Grand-Theft-Auto-IV-3" class="headerlink" title="10.Grand Theft Auto IV"></a>10.Grand Theft Auto IV</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gta4-poster.jpg"                      alt="gta4-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Microsoft Windows</p><p>In the franchise’s history, Grand Theft Auto IV was the first game to have online capabilities. While other Grand Theft Auto games adopted an arcade style of driving, this game focused on realistic driving mechanics. There isn’t nearly as much content as in Grand Theft Auto V’s online, but there is plenty to enjoy. The intriguing story mode in Grand Theft Auto IV focuses on protagonist Niko Bellic.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Gameplay footage can now be captured and shared in Video Editor.</p><p>• A great story driven by characters.</p><p>• Modifications and DLC are promised.</p><p>• Independence FM provides custom in-game music.</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict-3"><a href="#Final-Verdict-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>So, this was our list of 10 best games like GTA 5.

Now in case of shorter videos these variables really don’t really matter but when longer videos are to be made, normally for the purposes of education, game-streaming or documentaries these parameters can be the deciding and limiting factors. And from these factors the problem of time limited video recording is discussed below.</p><p>Default video recorders have a predefined limit to record for a certain time, which is a problem for lengthy videos and resetting the recording process can be very exhausting at times. So, to make impeccable videos, certain parameters have to be checked, other than the scene and setting itself, these parameters include video length, its quality and proper editing. Also, to tackle this problem the time-less recording or screen recording with no time limit is introduced. By using this tool long videos can be made without pause and later unwanted parts can be easily edited out of the video. There are different platforms available for the time-less screen recording, which are discussed below.</p><h2 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

How to disable crossplay? How about cross-progression? Further, which platform is the best to play on? What’s the difference between Steam and Origin?</p><p>In this article, all of the questions above will be answered. No doubt, we have seen a massive increase in the popularity of Apex Legends. Millions of players are grouping in EA’s battle royal game, and it is quite clear why they like it so much. It is a free-to-play game with some quality graphics and gameplay. This game’s core is based around looting and shooting, and it offers a few interesting twists in the battle royal format.</p><hr><h4 id="In-this-article-these-questions-will-be-answered"><a href="#In-this-article-these-questions-will-be-answered" class="headerlink" title="In this article, these questions will be answered"></a>In this article, these questions will be answered</h4><hr><p>Apex Legends Gameplay Basics:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-gameplay.jpg"                                     ></p><p>In this battle royal game, you are a part of a 3-person squad. There are 14 playable characters to choose from, and they are called legends in the game. If you compare all legends, you will find that they are equal in strength, speed, and firepower. It’s their special abilities that make them different from each other. Every character has a unique ability that can help you in-game to leverage other players. So, you can choose a legend that suits your playstyle and is a perfect fit for your squad.</p><p>Teamwork is very critical in this game. When you jump into the battleground, there are two teammates on your side. Make sure to stick with them during the match if you want to win it. By working together, you can protect each other and outmatch the enemies by combining your abilities. You can stay connected with your teammates using the in-game communication system. You can mark different locations, highlight threats, pinpoint the location of gear pieces, and tell your teammates in which direction you are going.</p><p>There is a ring around the battleground that shrinks after fixed short intervals. As the rink shrinks, it forces the players into a smaller space on the map, and as a result, we observe more fights between different teams. If you want to win the game, then you have to be the last team standing. If your teammates are knocked down, then you can revive them and pick them up. If they are completely killed, you can pick up their banner in a fixed amount of time and have them jumped back into the game once again. This feature makes this game different from other battle royal games where if your teammate dies once, then he stays dead the rest of the game.</p><p>One thing that you must keep in mind while playing this game is that killing an opponent is a bit longer than other FPS (First Person Shooting) games. To kill an opponent, you may need to rely on several headshots, your legends’ unique ability, and the support of your teammates.</p><p>Although this game is free of cost, it offers several in-game purchases. You can purchase Apex Coins, which is an in-game currency. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-ingame-purchase.jpg"                                     ></p><p>You can use it to purchase loot boxes that contain skins and costumes. There are two locked characters in the game also, and you need to purchase them with Apex coins. So, you can get the maximum out of this game by spending some money and giving time to this game.</p><hr><h4 id="Can-Apex-Legends-crossplay-or-not"><a href="#Can-Apex-Legends-crossplay-or-not" class="headerlink" title="Can Apex Legends crossplay or not?"></a><strong>Can Apex Legends crossplay or not?</strong></h4><p>Yes, Apex Legends is a cross-platform game. Initially, it wasn’t a cross-platform game, but Apex became a cross-platform game after an update in autumn 2020. It means that two players playing on two different devices can group in a squad and play the game. Let’s explain it with an example. Suppose you have a pc and your friend has a PS4. Both of you can play together in a squad, even if you both have two different types of devices.</p><h4 id="How-to-turn-off-crossplay"><a href="#How-to-turn-off-crossplay" class="headerlink" title="How to turn off crossplay?"></a><strong>How to turn off crossplay?</strong></h4><p>Firstly, crossplay is enabled by default. Assume now you’re playing apex on PS4&#x2F;switch&#x2F;Xbox using a controller, you might be reluctant to crossplay against a PC player using keyboard and mouse. Because you might think that isn’t fair. So why don’t we turn it off and play only with game console players?</p><p>Step1, to disable it, you need to go to the setting button at the lobby’s right bottom, as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apex-setting1.png"                      alt="ape-setting1"                ></p><p>Step 2, under the gameplay tab, scroll down, and you can find cross-platform play.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apex-setting2.png"                      alt="apex-setting2"                ></p><h4 id="Does-it-have-cross-progression"><a href="#Does-it-have-cross-progression" class="headerlink" title="Does it have cross-progression?"></a><strong>Does it have cross-progression?</strong></h4><p>Unfortunately, because of technical and legal issues, no.

Although the game will run just fine, you may need to make some adjustments to your graphics settings. You can play this game on 720p on Xbox One S, so make sure to sit a little closer to your screen to see everything.</p><p>If you want to get Apex’s best experience on Xbox consoles, you should play it on Xbox One X. If you switch from Xbox one S to Xbox one X, you will see a significant difference in the game performance. On the X version, you can run the game on 1080p.

But, the question is, Can you play Apex on the latest generations of Xbox? The answer is yes. You will get better performance in terms of graphics and FPS but currently, the game isn’t fully optimized for the latest generations. In the coming days it is expected that the game will be optimized for the latest consoles and you can enjoy the game to the fullest. Currently, you can enjoy 1440p gaming on these consoles and can get up to 120fps.</p><p><strong>Sony PlayStation 4</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-ps4.png"                                     >You can also play Apex Legends on Sony PlayStation 4.

How to disable crossplay? How about cross-progression? Further, which platform is the best to play on? What’s the difference between Steam and Origin?</p><p>In this article, all of the questions above will be answered. No doubt, we have seen a massive increase in the popularity of Apex Legends. Millions of players are grouping in EA’s battle royal game, and it is quite clear why they like it so much. It is a free-to-play game with some quality graphics and gameplay. This game’s core is based around looting and shooting, and it offers a few interesting twists in the battle royal format.</p><hr><h4 id="In-this-article-these-questions-will-be-answered-1"><a href="#In-this-article-these-questions-will-be-answered-1" class="headerlink" title="In this article, these questions will be answered"></a>In this article, these questions will be answered</h4><hr><p>Apex Legends Gameplay Basics:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-gameplay.jpg"                                     ></p><p>In this battle royal game, you are a part of a 3-person squad. There are 14 playable characters to choose from, and they are called legends in the game. If you compare all legends, you will find that they are equal in strength, speed, and firepower. It’s their special abilities that make them different from each other. Every character has a unique ability that can help you in-game to leverage other players. So, you can choose a legend that suits your playstyle and is a perfect fit for your squad.</p><p>Teamwork is very critical in this game. When you jump into the battleground, there are two teammates on your side. Make sure to stick with them during the match if you want to win it. By working together, you can protect each other and outmatch the enemies by combining your abilities. You can stay connected with your teammates using the in-game communication system. You can mark different locations, highlight threats, pinpoint the location of gear pieces, and tell your teammates in which direction you are going.</p><p>There is a ring around the battleground that shrinks after fixed short intervals. As the rink shrinks, it forces the players into a smaller space on the map, and as a result, we observe more fights between different teams. If you want to win the game, then you have to be the last team standing. If your teammates are knocked down, then you can revive them and pick them up. If they are completely killed, you can pick up their banner in a fixed amount of time and have them jumped back into the game once again. This feature makes this game different from other battle royal games where if your teammate dies once, then he stays dead the rest of the game.</p><p>One thing that you must keep in mind while playing this game is that killing an opponent is a bit longer than other FPS (First Person Shooting) games. To kill an opponent, you may need to rely on several headshots, your legends’ unique ability, and the support of your teammates.</p><p>Although this game is free of cost, it offers several in-game purchases. You can purchase Apex Coins, which is an in-game currency. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Apex-ingame-purchase.jpg"                                     ></p><p>You can use it to purchase loot boxes that contain skins and costumes. There are two locked characters in the game also, and you need to purchase them with Apex coins. So, you can get the maximum out of this game by spending some money and giving time to this game.</p><hr><h4 id="Can-Apex-Legends-crossplay-or-not-1"><a href="#Can-Apex-Legends-crossplay-or-not-1" class="headerlink" title="Can Apex Legends crossplay or not?"></a><strong>Can Apex Legends crossplay or not?</strong></h4><p>Yes, Apex Legends is a cross-platform game. Initially, it wasn’t a cross-platform game, but Apex became a cross-platform game after an update in autumn 2020. It means that two players playing on two different devices can group in a squad and play the game. Let’s explain it with an example. Suppose you have a pc and your friend has a PS4. Both of you can play together in a squad, even if you both have two different types of devices.</p><h4 id="How-to-turn-off-crossplay-1"><a href="#How-to-turn-off-crossplay-1" class="headerlink" title="How to turn off crossplay?"></a><strong>How to turn off crossplay?</strong></h4><p>Firstly, crossplay is enabled by default.

With just one click, the host of the meeting can also mute everyone in the session so there are no extra sounds or distractions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134239/18498" target="_top" id="2134239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134239/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Mute-Your-Microphone-in-Google-Meet"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Mute-Your-Microphone-in-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Mute Your Microphone in Google Meet?"></a>Part 2: How to Mute Your Microphone in Google Meet?</h2><p>While many believe using the mute feature on Google Meet is a tricky task, the question of <strong>how to mute a Google Meet</strong> is fairly simple.</p><p>All an individual has to do is click the microphone button located on the bottom of their screen and they will be muted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-microphone-on-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet Mute"                ></p><p>If they click that same button again, they will be unmuted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unmute-yourself-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet unmute"                ></p><p>However, if they do not want to make use of the screen to mute and unmute, they can use keyboard key shortcuts.

If you want a better alternative to OBS Studio and Fraps, we recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best screen recording software for Windows and Mac.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-amplify-your-music-experience-with-youtubes-playlist-guide-for-2024/"><u>[New] Amplify Your Music Experience with YouTube's Playlist Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-whatsapp-video-transfers-from-tweeted-content-for-2024/"><u>[New] WhatsApp Video Transfers From Tweeted Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-aspire-with-angles-crafting-compelling-visuals-through-instagram-rotation/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Aspire with Angles Crafting Compelling Visuals Through Instagram Rotation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/1716069553526-updated-in-2024-screen-savvy-secure-your-captures-chromebooks-top-4-techniques/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Screen Savvy Secure Your Captures - Chromebook's Top 4 Techniques!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-intuitive-methods-to-log-your-google-voice-conversations/"><u>2024 Approved Intuitive Methods to Log Your Google Voice Conversations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-visualcapture-reviewer-tool/"><u>2024 Approved VisualCapture Reviewer Tool</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/data-integration-in-microsoft-excel-the-ultimate-guide-to-merging-two-columns/"><u>Data Integration in Microsoft Excel: The Ultimate Guide to Merging Two Columns</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/effortless-and-easy-video-snapshots-of-win11-for-2024/"><u>Effortless & Easy Video Snapshots of Win11 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-cross-platform-movie-recording-pc-mac-and-mobile/"><u>In 2024, Cross-Platform Movie Recording PC, Mac & Mobile</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-rapid-growth-techniques-for-youtube-views-via-collaborative-videos/"><u>In 2024, Rapid Growth Techniques for YouTube Views via Collaborative Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-recording-device-feedback-guide/"><u>In 2024, Recording Device Feedback Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-securing-your-online-discussions/"><u>In 2024, Securing Your Online Discussions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-hilarious-and-emotional-instagram-memes-journey/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Hilarious & Emotional Instagram Memes Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/the-long-awaited-arrival-immortals-fenyx-rising-game-is-now-out-of-the-gate/"><u>The Long-Awaited Arrival!

Vibration can be enabled or disabled by selecting a controller from the “Detected Controllers” list in the same setup screen as before.

There are several ways to map the inputs on the Pro Controller, but default configurations are usually sufficient for most games. By changing the controller mapping based on the situation, you can fix any problems on the fly.</p><h2 id="What-To-Do-With-Non-Steam-Games"><a href="#What-To-Do-With-Non-Steam-Games" class="headerlink" title="What To Do With Non-Steam Games?"></a><strong>What To Do With Non-Steam Games?</strong></h2><p>Using the methods discussed above, you can easily use a switch pro controller with your pc, but it only works with steam games. But what if you want to play a non-steam game using a switch pro controller? What will you do now? The switch pro controller hardware support will run out of luck in this scenario.</p><p>The main problem here now is how windows will detect your switch pro controller now if you want to play non-steam games. Luckily there are two simple solutions for this problem.</p><p><strong>Solution1:</strong> The first solution is to use an external Bluetooth adapter that is specifically designed for different types of gamepads. You will find plenty of them out there for switch pro controllers.</p><p><strong>Solution2:</strong> The second method is to use a software-based XInput Wrapper. There is plenty of software out there that provides this functionality. Just configure your switch pro controller with them, and you can easily use it on non-steam games.</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>This is how you can use your switch pro controller with your PC. Now you can easily enjoy your favorite games on one of the finest controllers available in the market today. All you need to do is, follow some simple steps mentioned in this article, and you are good to go. You can connect it both with wire and wirelessly. It is comparatively easy to connect it through the wire, and the performance of the controller is also slightly better when it is connected through a wire.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997630/19272" target="_top" id="1997630">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997630" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997630/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><h5 id="Ollie-Mattison-1"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison-1" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Nintendo did not design the Switch Pro controller with PC gamers in mind, but that won’t stop us from using it.

Vibration can be enabled or disabled by selecting a controller from the “Detected Controllers” list in the same setup screen as before. It is possible to calibrate the analog sticks by clicking the Calibrate button manually. Also, the controller can be set to disconnect after a specified amount of time before going to sleep.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-pro-controller-steam-set-up2.png"                      alt="switch-pro-controller-steam-set-up2"                ></p><p>Enter the Switch Pro Controller overlay from Steam’s controller options while running in Big Picture mode.

But what if you want to play a non-steam game using a switch pro controller? What will you do now? The switch pro controller hardware support will run out of luck in this scenario.</p><p>The main problem here now is how windows will detect your switch pro controller now if you want to play non-steam games. Luckily there are two simple solutions for this problem.</p><p><strong>Solution1:</strong> The first solution is to use an external Bluetooth adapter that is specifically designed for different types of gamepads. You will find plenty of them out there for switch pro controllers.</p><p><strong>Solution2:</strong> The second method is to use a software-based XInput Wrapper. There is plenty of software out there that provides this functionality. Just configure your switch pro controller with them, and you can easily use it on non-steam games.</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict-3"><a href="#Final-Verdict-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>This is how you can use your switch pro controller with your PC.

All you need to do is, follow some simple steps mentioned in this article, and you are good to go. You can connect it both with wire and wirelessly.

After Filmora’s main window loads, you should head over to the Media tab, and click on the Record drop-down menu that is located next to the Import drop-down menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-pc-screen.jpg"                      alt="Filmora9 Record PC Screen"                ></p><p>You can then choose if you want to record videos using the built-in or external webcam, record a voiceover or capture your computer’s screen and webcam video at the same time. Select the Record PC Screen option and wait for the Wondershare Filmora Scrn window to pop up on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-pc-screen-3.jpg"                      alt="Filmora9 PC Screen Recording Settings"                ></p><p>Click on the Settings icon in the lower right corner of the window if you want to change the frame rate of the video you’re creating or adjust its quality. The screen recorder lets you capture an entire screen, a target window, and it offers the possibility to specify the portion of the screen you would like to capture.</p><p>Connecting an <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >external microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is also an option if you don’t want to record the voiceover with your computer’s built-in microphone. Selecting the destination folder where your recordings are going to be saved, picking a preferred <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >frame rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or choosing the quality of the video you’re capturing are also among the options you’ll have at your disposal.</p><p>Make sure to tick the Show Mouse Clicks in Recording checkbox if you would like your video to include all mouse clicks you make during a screen capturing session. Filmora also offers the option to record all mouse click sounds, but most content creators disable this setting as mouse clicks can be very repetitive.</p><p>Record the Camera Stream checkbox is located at the bottom of the Wondershare Filmora Scrn window, and you have to click on it if you want to record your computer screen and the webcam video simultaneously. By default, the computer’s built-in webcam is going to be selected, but you can also select an external webcam you connected to your computer, from the drop-down menu located directly below the Record the Camera Stream checkbox.</p><p>Optionally, you can set the keyboard shortcuts that enable you to start, stop, pause and resume a screen recording session. Click on the Record button when ready and proceed to record your computer’s screen and the webcam stream simultaneously.</p><p>After the screen capturing session, the video file you created will be located in the destination folder you specified and appeared in the media library automatically, so you just have to place it onto the timeline if you want to edit it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049370/7443" target="_top" id="2049370">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049370" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049370/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-a-Computer-Screen-and-Webcam-Video-at-the-same-time-on-Windows-10"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-a-Computer-Screen-and-Webcam-Video-at-the-same-time-on-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Record a Computer Screen and Webcam Video at the same time on Windows 10?"></a>Part 2: How to Record a Computer Screen and Webcam Video at the same time on Windows 10?</h2><p>All you need to do in order to access the Game Bar on Windows 10 is to use the Win + G keyboard shortcut. The screen capturing options you will have at your disposal are underwhelming at best since you won’t be able to select the resolution or the frame rate of the video you’re recording. However, you just need to enable the microphone and click on the Record button to start capturing the gameplay of the video game you’re playing or any other activity on your computer.</p><p>Even though it is possible to record a webcam video and capture a screen simultaneously, you can only do so if you install additional encoders. It may take a while to figure out the exact steps of this highly technical process, and once you do, you still won’t be able to record the webcam video stream and capture a computer screen with the same app.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528703/16446" target="_top" id="1528703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528703/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Capturing-Screens-with-Loom-Extension-for-Google-Chrome"><a href="#Part-3-Capturing-Screens-with-Loom-Extension-for-Google-Chrome" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Capturing Screens with Loom Extension for Google Chrome"></a>Part 3: Capturing Screens with Loom Extension for Google Chrome</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loom-video-recorder-scree/liecbddmkiiihnedobmlmillhodjkdmb?hl=en-US" >Loom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> extension for Google Chrome web browser offers a simple and easy solution to all PC users who would like to record screens and webcam videos at the same time. The extension can be downloaded for free, and the setup process won’t take much more than a few moments. Before you can start using Loom, you must first sign in using your Google account and then grant the extension access to your computer’s microphone and camera.</p><p>This extension for Google Chrome lets you choose if you want to record only the computer’s screen, webcam or both at the same time. Furthermore, you can specify which microphone and camera you would like to use during a screen capturing session before you hit the record button. Loom will record all of your screen activities and you can use it to record your gaming experiences, create tutorials or any other type of video that includes the tasks you perform on your computer.</p><p>However, you may meet some audio quality issues on some occasions, and once recorded, the editing options are limited (though I can add A CTA button and do some setting, I can’t do other editing such as add title, adjust speed and mute audio in the video except trimming).</p><p>So, if you want to record the webcam and screen at the same time, and edit the recorded footage further with effects, transitions, titles, we recommend you to try Filmora. Filmora is easy to use and powerful enough to record, and edit your video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135371/19272" target="_top" id="2135371">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135371" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135371/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Including the webcam footage in your screen recordings can make them more entertaining to watch, since viewers can actually see the person who is talking to them. Although Windows 10’s Game Bar features the tools you are going to need to record a computer screen, capturing the webcam video stream simultaneously is a highly technical and time-consuming task. That is why it is much better to use Filmora or the Loom extension for Google Chrome if you want to record your screen and use a webcam at the same time. Which method of capturing webcam video streams and computer screens do you like to use the most?

The workplace communication needs are evolving significantly and every one of us, individuals, companies, and organizations need to adapt promptly to the new ways of collaborating. Advanced technologies have now made it possible to <strong>make a group chat</strong> with family, friends, school, and coworkers to constantly stay updated with the latest family happenings or the progress of a particular project you’re working on. <strong>Skype group chat</strong> allows you to swiftly send messages, videos, pictures, etc. to multiple people at once while constantly apprising the group members of the latest events and developments.

However, today Skype group chat makes it possible for anyone to connect and collaborate with several people without any barriers and limitations.</p><p>To make a group chat on Skype using a Windows operating system you can get connected with individuals from diverse localities of the world within a minute. To make a Skype group chat for yourself follow along with the steps below.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.skype.com/"><strong>Download Skype</strong></a> on your Windows PC. You’ll need to sign in with a Microsoft account or sign up if you haven’t already had a Skype account.</li><li>Once you’ve logged in to Skype you’ll be presented with a similar interface with “Recent Chats” showing up in the left pane. To make a group chat click on the drop-down icon next to the “New Chat” button and select “New Group Chat” and your new Skype group chat is only a few clicks away.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-group-chat1.jpg"                      alt="new group chat"                ></p><ul><li>A new window will appear in the Skype main screen. Here you’ll have to write the name of the group and select a picture for the group chat. The name should represent the purpose of the chat group to make sense to its participants, I’ve selected a figurative name for the sake of an example. After you’re done with the name and picture, press the ahead arrow.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-group-name2.jpg"                      alt="create group name"                ></p><ul><li>Skype will take you to your contact list to choose the members for your new chat group.

It’s difficult to walk down the street on PC without zombie games grabbing at your leg, so it’s a legitimate concern. Don’t write off the genre because there are a few brainless clones - we’ve compiled a list of some of the zombie games to hit PC.</p><p>There are a lot of zombie enemies in the zombie games, and they enjoy eating brains, and there’s a lot more to them than that. You’ll be forced to put your survival and fighting abilities to the test in a hostile environment, and you’ll discover how humankind can come together in the face of hardship. The zombie games provide a wide range of action-packed adventures that are both complex and entertaining.</p><p>Here are the greatest zombie videogames you can play right now, starting with number 10 and working your way up to our top one pick. Our list of zombie games contains tales with repercussions, resource management, traditional Capcom danger, and more. You’ll be able to discover your new zombie-filled adventure here since it covers a wide range of genres.</p><h3 id="1-Worldwar-Z"><a href="#1-Worldwar-Z" class="headerlink" title="1.Worldwar Z"></a>1.Worldwar Z</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/worldwar-z-poster.jpg"                      alt="worldwar-z-poster"                ></p><p>There isn’t much to World War Z by itself, but there isn’t a better game for mow down dozens, if not hundreds, of zombies with a group of friends or strangers. It’s based in part on the Brad Pitt film from 2013. Nonetheless, it’s mainly an excuse to repeat the film’s one distinguishing attribute: swarms of monsters that rush down streets and crash around curves like a torrent through a breached dam.</p><p>It is undeniably influenced by the Left 4 Dead series (RIP). It does, however, have several modern game mainstays like selectable classes &amp; permanent progression. You may choose to play as a Horror flick, who gets extra health by rapidly killing enemies, a Fixer, who places traps in safe areas, or even one of four additional classes. Whatever character you select to level up first, you’ll get to fire a lot of lead into sliding walls of decaying flesh.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123737/7443" target="_top" id="2123737">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123737" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123737/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Dying-Light-The-Following"><a href="#2-Dying-Light-The-Following" class="headerlink" title="2.Dying Light: The Following"></a>2.Dying Light: The Following</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dying-light-the-following-poster.jpg"                      alt="dying-light-the-following-poster"                ></p><p>Running over zombies has never been more fun. The Foregoing is really a DLC for Dying Light that eliminates much of the parkour again from the original game and instead places you behind the wheel of a car across a stretch of nearly spotless countryside. Splatter zombies spewing gore and leave tire tracks in their guts as you drive across the fields, attempting daring jumps. Just make sure you don’t get a monster head caught in your wipers.</p><h3 id="3-State-of-the-Decay-2"><a href="#3-State-of-the-Decay-2" class="headerlink" title="3.State of the Decay 2"></a>3.State of the Decay 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/state-of-the-decay-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="state-of-the-decay-2-poster"                ></p><p>Unlike Project Zomboid, which concentrates primarily on the concept of being an ordinary person in an unfair position, the States of Decay series tries to keep you amused with the beautiful midwestern countryside and Gorey entertaining combat even while your supplies run out and zombies smash down your gate.</p><p>The introduction of multiplayer in States of Decay 2 is probably the most intriguing new feature. Inviting people to help protect and hunt for your village greatly expands the scope of procedurally produced tales. It also enables you to put to the test all of those zombie outbreak survival tactics you’ve spent way too much time talking with your pals.</p><h3 id="4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019"><a href="#4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019" class="headerlink" title="4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)"></a>4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resident-evil-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="resident-evil-2-poster"                ></p><p>Resident Evil 2’s sequel treads a thin line between the sluggish horror of the original Resident Evil game and the quicker (but still methodical) action of the post-Resident Evil 7 period. It succeeds in being both a worthy homage to the first Resident Evil 2 and the most important, playable RE games in years as a result of this. The key is the zombies, as you’d expect from a game that ranks among the zombie games. Even while the remake’s mobility and shooting controls seem to be more contemporary and streamlined, each zombie can only take so many shots - even headshot - before resurrecting. Even immediately in front of your eyes, or perhaps a few minutes later, when you believe you are secure.</p><p>In the remake of Resident Evil 2, the perfect aim isn’t enough to ensure your life. The most essential element is caution since you save ammunition by firing to stun rather than kill. You could even decide the zombies can take the passageway while you retain the ammunition. It’s still not as terrifying as the other major Resident Evil remake in terms of sheer dread. However, the Resident Evil 2’s remake is undoubtedly more enjoyable to play, earning it a place on our list of zombie games.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151856/7443" target="_top" id="2151856">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151856" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151856/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-The-Walking-Dead"><a href="#5-The-Walking-Dead" class="headerlink" title="5.The Walking Dead"></a>5.The Walking Dead</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-walking-dead-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-walking-dead-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135373/19272" target="_top" id="2135373">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135373" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135373/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>You play Lee Everett, a convicted murderer who takes in an orphaned young girl called Clementine as his charge. You’ll make choices that will have significant repercussions for your group members when you meet more survivors. The worst part is that you develop feelings for the people in your group. As a consequence, when bad things happen, you’ll feel as though you’ve just seen a real-life buddy being eaten rather than a video game character. People will die, unexpected events will occur, and choices will need to be made. You’ll have to live with the repercussions.</p><h3 id="6-The-HD-Remaster-of-Resident-Evil"><a href="#6-The-HD-Remaster-of-Resident-Evil" class="headerlink" title="6.The HD Remaster of Resident Evil"></a>6.The HD Remaster of Resident Evil</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remaster-of-resident-evil-poster.png"                      alt="remaster-of-resident-evil-poster"                ></p><p>The utter loneliness of becoming one of the last humans with a heartbeat within some several-mile radius is something that the first Resident Evil gets right that many zombie games miss out on. Resident Evil High-Definition Remaster is a somewhat updated version of Resident Evil GameCube update from 2002, maintaining the terrible desolation in its entirety. Don’t get us wrong: the 2015 remake should have done a lot more (those pre-rendered backdrops are starting to seem a little fuzzy these days), but what’s there is still a landmark survival horror classic.</p><p>The Resident Evil update isn’t just one of the best zombie games because of its unique perspective on the undead; it’s one of the best zombie games because of its unique perspective what to do, in particular, with one that seems to have ceased to move. You would like to make sure you put zombies down with just a headshot or burn their bodies afterward because if you don’t, the monster known as a “crimson head” will spring up later. Shivers go down your spine just uttering the word.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993645">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993645.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993645">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993645.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993645%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993645/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-The-Last-of-Us"><a href="#7-The-Last-of-Us" class="headerlink" title="7.The Last of Us"></a>7.The Last of Us</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-last-of-us-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-last-of-us-poster"                ></p><p>The Last of Us, which won the game of Year in 2013, is still the best zombie game ever made over six years later. It sends you on a perilous cross-country journey across a largely post-human America. The planet is filled with desperate weapon survivalists, a totalitarian government, and violent rebel groups, apart from mushroom-brained undead with fangs eager to tear your jugular out. The greatest part is that you have to do it all with a sassy young woman who alternates between making fun of you and rescuing your life.</p><p>The journey of Joel and Ellie would be both dark and terrifying.

You’re smack dab in the middle of a battle with the Ridden. That once hosts of a terrible infection have evolved into frightening monsters intent on eating civilization’s ruins. It’s up to you and your allies to take the battle to the enemy, eliminate the Ridden, and recapture the planet, with humanity’s extinction on the line.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started today with Filmora’s powerful performance, user-friendly interface, and thousands of effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><p>There isn’t much to World War Z by itself, but there isn’t a better game for mow down dozens, if not hundreds, of zombies with a group of friends or strangers.

It also enables you to put to the test all of those zombie outbreak survival tactics you’ve spent way too much time talking with your pals.</p><h3 id="4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019-3"><a href="#4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)"></a>4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resident-evil-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="resident-evil-2-poster"                ></p><p>Resident Evil 2’s sequel treads a thin line between the sluggish horror of the original Resident Evil game and the quicker (but still methodical) action of the post-Resident Evil 7 period. It succeeds in being both a worthy homage to the first Resident Evil 2 and the most important, playable RE games in years as a result of this. The key is the zombies, as you’d expect from a game that ranks among the zombie games. Even while the remake’s mobility and shooting controls seem to be more contemporary and streamlined, each zombie can only take so many shots - even headshot - before resurrecting. Even immediately in front of your eyes, or perhaps a few minutes later, when you believe you are secure.</p><p>In the remake of Resident Evil 2, the perfect aim isn’t enough to ensure your life. The most essential element is caution since you save ammunition by firing to stun rather than kill. You could even decide the zombies can take the passageway while you retain the ammunition. It’s still not as terrifying as the other major Resident Evil remake in terms of sheer dread. However, the Resident Evil 2’s remake is undoubtedly more enjoyable to play, earning it a place on our list of zombie games.</p><h3 id="5-The-Walking-Dead-3"><a href="#5-The-Walking-Dead-3" class="headerlink" title="5.The Walking Dead"></a>5.The Walking Dead</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-walking-dead-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-walking-dead-poster"                ></p><p>You play Lee Everett, a convicted murderer who takes in an orphaned young girl called Clementine as his charge. You’ll make choices that will have significant repercussions for your group members when you meet more survivors. The worst part is that you develop feelings for the people in your group. As a consequence, when bad things happen, you’ll feel as though you’ve just seen a real-life buddy being eaten rather than a video game character. People will die, unexpected events will occur, and choices will need to be made. You’ll have to live with the repercussions.</p><h3 id="6-The-HD-Remaster-of-Resident-Evil-3"><a href="#6-The-HD-Remaster-of-Resident-Evil-3" class="headerlink" title="6.The HD Remaster of Resident Evil"></a>6.The HD Remaster of Resident Evil</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remaster-of-resident-evil-poster.png"                      alt="remaster-of-resident-evil-poster"                ></p><p>The utter loneliness of becoming one of the last humans with a heartbeat within some several-mile radius is something that the first Resident Evil gets right that many zombie games miss out on. Resident Evil High-Definition Remaster is a somewhat updated version of Resident Evil GameCube update from 2002, maintaining the terrible desolation in its entirety. Don’t get us wrong: the 2015 remake should have done a lot more (those pre-rendered backdrops are starting to seem a little fuzzy these days), but what’s there is still a landmark survival horror classic.</p><p>The Resident Evil update isn’t just one of the best zombie games because of its unique perspective on the undead; it’s one of the best zombie games because of its unique perspective what to do, in particular, with one that seems to have ceased to move. You would like to make sure you put zombies down with just a headshot or burn their bodies afterward because if you don’t, the monster known as a “crimson head” will spring up later. Shivers go down your spine just uttering the word.</p><h3 id="7-The-Last-of-Us-3"><a href="#7-The-Last-of-Us-3" class="headerlink" title="7.The Last of Us"></a>7.The Last of Us</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-last-of-us-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-last-of-us-poster"                ></p><p>The Last of Us, which won the game of Year in 2013, is still the best zombie game ever made over six years later. It sends you on a perilous cross-country journey across a largely post-human America. The planet is filled with desperate weapon survivalists, a totalitarian government, and violent rebel groups, apart from mushroom-brained undead with fangs eager to tear your jugular out. The greatest part is that you have to do it all with a sassy young woman who alternates between making fun of you and rescuing your life.</p><p>The journey of Joel and Ellie would be both dark and terrifying. The decaying, gloomy surroundings set the tone for the stealth&#x2F;survival action, making the tension almost unbearable.</p><h3 id="8-Back-4-Blood-3"><a href="#8-Back-4-Blood-3" class="headerlink" title="8.Back 4 Blood"></a>8.Back 4 Blood</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/back4blood-poster.jpg"                      alt="back4blood-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Back 4 Blood is an action-packed cooperative first-person action from the highly popular Left 4 Dead series developers.

The MMO industry generates 10 billion dollars a year and reaches audiences much larger than that. You can find plenty of both free MMORPG games and paid MMORPG’s. World of Warcraft, for example, has players who have cumulatively spent more time on Azeroth than the human species has existed on this planet for 6 million years. The underlying idea behind all these big numbers is a simple one: anyone, anywhere, can become anything in this virtual world (and grind out some loot along the way).</p><p>Unlike the text-based multi-user dungeons from which MMOs evolved, today’s MMOs are incredibly sophisticated. These games offer the best of the genre, be it as humanoid cats or as ruthless dictators. We’ve rounded up the best online games you can play today to celebrate that awesome lineage—and help you find the one that is worth your time. To make things simpler, we’ve also categorized them to give you a good idea of what makes each game exceptional. Also, we will share a list of free MMORPG games, so you don’t need to worry about paying anything to play these games.</p><p> You can check <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Clicker Games to Kill time&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-World-of-Warcraft"><a href="#1-World-of-Warcraft" class="headerlink" title="1. World of Warcraft"></a><strong>1. World of Warcraft</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Understandably, you may think the world of Warcraft isn’t a free MMORPG. So why is it listed? You can play the first 20 levels of the game for free, and since 20 levels mean a lot of time in World of Warcraft, you should have no problem playing it all. It is for this reason that it has been included on this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/world-of-warcraft-poster.jpg"                      alt="world-of-warcraft-poster"                ></p><p>There are not many people who are unfamiliar with the world of Warcraft. It’s a game that’s synonymous with the MMORPG genre. It offers players an expansive, ever-expanding universe filled with content to discover. All the elements of a quality MMORPG are present in this game, such as character customization, a persistent open world, and a compelling storyline. Getting started with World of Warcraft should be your top priority if you haven’t done so already. A game like this shouldn’t be missed.</p><h4 id="2-Guild-Wars-2"><a href="#2-Guild-Wars-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Guild Wars 2"></a><strong>2. Guild Wars 2</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Another free MMORPG for beginners to start with, Guild Wars 2, has an interesting storyline that changes based on your decisions. You won’t find that in other games of its kind. As with most other MMORPGs, the game includes general features like character customization, crafting, and strong PvP and PvP elements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/guild-wars-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>It takes place in the fantasy world of Tyria and lets players explore a vast persistent world alone or with friends. As part of Guild Wars 2’s story, there are also a number of instanced environments that players will encounter. Guild Wars 2’s dynamic action-based mechanic makes leveling up far more enjoyable than World of Warcraft, which is sometimes considered a grind. If you’re tired of the monotony of leveling up in other MMORPGs, this game is for you.</p><h4 id="3-Secret-Worlds-Legends"><a href="#3-Secret-Worlds-Legends" class="headerlink" title="3. Secret Worlds Legends"></a><strong>3. Secret Worlds Legends</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Secret World Legends is another recent convert to the free-to-play model. The game is defined at least partly by its setting, which is the stuff of conspiracy theory crackpots’ dreams (or their worst nightmares). A world shrouded in mystery and filled with supernatural horrors is characterized by secret societies, mythological creatures, and evil cults. This game’s events are given a dramatic sweeping sweep by some killer sound design, which effectively amps up the tension.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/secret-worlds-legends-poster.jpg"                      alt="Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>The game’s dedication to storytelling is one of its strongest features. Instead of the standard MMO trope of allowing players to queue up an out-of-control number of quests with no sense of overarching purpose, the Secret World focuses on a small number of quests at a time with clearly defined goals. The game’s narrative is emphasized by narrowing the focus, and its writing and atmosphere are showcased, which is of a fairly uniform high quality.</p><h4 id="4-Star-Conflict"><a href="#4-Star-Conflict" class="headerlink" title="4. Star Conflict"></a><strong>4. Star Conflict</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms</strong>: Windows, Xbox One</p><p>Try Star Conflict if you like space exploration. The free MMORPG puts you in the role of a space pilot seeking out alien treasures scattered all over its expansive universe. During Star Conflict, you are tasked with collecting various spaceships, for example, fighters or massive satellites that you can float in space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/star-conflict-poster.jpg"                      alt="Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>There are a variety of PvE quests and raids in the game, where you have to fight alien squadrons and space pirates and PvP while floating around in outer space in your spaceship. You can also customize your spaceship using various weapon types or ship modules organized under a tech tree. Another great feature of Star Conflict is that it allows players to experience the game in virtual reality with Oculus Rift.</p><h4 id="5-Skyforge"><a href="#5-Skyforge" class="headerlink" title="5. Skyforge"></a><strong>5. Skyforge</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows</p><p>Throughout your apotheosis, you become a god, gaining followers, and ascending to godhood in a sci-fi world fully equipped with advanced technology. That’s true, all those words do not typically go together, but let’s not give up just yet. When you can make your own god in Skyforge, why be a mere minion in a vast world filled with other loot-grinders?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skyforge-poster.jpg"                      alt="Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>Unlike many typical MMOs, Skyforge offers players the ability to change their class at any time, so matchmaking is smooth and level progression is no longer necessary. In the prestige system, characters are ranked according to their general stats rather than by leveling up. Skyforge offers a nice diversion from other MMO’s grind by changing traditional MMO systems, offering a fascinating sci-fi world, and offering action-oriented combat.</p><h4 id="6-DC-Universe-Online"><a href="#6-DC-Universe-Online" class="headerlink" title="6. DC Universe Online"></a><strong>6. DC Universe Online</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One</p><p>DC Universe Online, an online MMORPG with custom abilities, offers the opportunity to build your own superhero and play with well-known heroes from the DC multiverse, such as Wonder Woman, Superman and Batman, among others.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dc-universe-online-poster.jpg"                      alt="Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>In addition to its unique combat tab-targeting system which makes it stand out from other games on this list, it also makes the game more user-friendly for players. As well as having a captivating storyline, cool gear to collect, and levels that allow players to choose how they want to progress in the game, DC Universe Online offers many other features that will appeal to gamers.</p><h4 id="7-Lord-of-the-Rings-Online"><a href="#7-Lord-of-the-Rings-Online" class="headerlink" title="7. Lord of the Rings Online"></a><strong>7. Lord of the Rings Online</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>The Lord of the Rings Online is an MMORPG based in the impeccably detailed LOTR universe that is perfect for fans of medieval fantasy and Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings. With the game, players go on a journey across Middle Earth, fighting alongside familiar characters and exploring locations such as those in the movies.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lord-of-the-rings-online-poster.jpg"                      alt="Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>There is just one small exception to the gameplay of Lord of the Rings Online, but it’s no different than any other MMORPG on this list. There are no large scale PvP opportunities in LOTR Online, since all characters in the game are on the same side. It instead provides players with a Monster Play mode that allows them to create a monster at level ten and battle other players within Ettenmoor.</p><h4 id="8-Star-Trek-Online"><a href="#8-Star-Trek-Online" class="headerlink" title="8. Star Trek Online"></a><strong>8. Star Trek Online</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC</p><p>In addition to its solid license, Star Trek Online offers a rich and unique gameplay experience that is unbeatable in the MMO market. With its spaceships and aliens, and a consistent blend of third-person shooter and naval simulator, Space Truckers Online is an addictive game that will keep you hooked with its spaceships and aliens.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/star-trek-online-poster.jpg"                      alt="Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>Many familiar elements are found in the series and films that are as enjoyable to discover as they sound. Fan service is done right in Star Trek: The Original Series by blowing up borg cubes, strolling Deep Space Nine’s promenade, or beaming down to exotic planets as part of an away team. A new story expansion on the Alpha Quadrant, launching at the end of January, offers new gameplay content set in a previously unexplored sector, as well as a number of recent limited-time events and minigames.</p><h4 id="9-ArcheAge"><a href="#9-ArcheAge" class="headerlink" title="9. ArcheAge"></a><strong>9. ArcheAge</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>You can do pretty much anything in ArcheAge, a medieval fantasy game that takes you to a medieval fantasy world. If you want to be a powerful warrior, you can do so with a huge sword of your own and a big group of friends at your side, or you can become an economics expert and take on the challenges of farming and trade. As a pirate, you can rob traders and plunder their goods.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/archeage-poster.jpg"                      alt="Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>Additionally, Mounts and Travel play an important role in ArcheAge. On top of riding wild animals such as lions and deer across its colossal world, you can also take to the air and sea. You can sail the oceans in anything from rowboats to warships, and there are also aerial modes of transportation like gliders and airships. Archeage shows how dedicated Trion is (and the resources that they have available to them) in its polish and longevity.</p><h4 id="10-EVE-Online"><a href="#10-EVE-Online" class="headerlink" title="10. EVE Online"></a><strong>10. EVE Online</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>EVE Online is still the premier space MMO, and it has been the source of many memorable gaming stories, owing to the way it focuses on a few elements and excels at them. As well as meticulous simulations and systems, CCP pays attention to its dedicated community and responds appropriately, as it is often their subscribers who make the decisions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/eve-online-poster.jpg"                      alt="eve-online-poster"                ></p><p>Although detractors dismiss EVE as spreadsheets in space, the criticism highlights one of its strongest points: its real and thriving economy.

You won’t find that in other games of its kind. As with most other MMORPGs, the game includes general features like character customization, crafting, and strong PvP and PvP elements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/guild-wars-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>It takes place in the fantasy world of Tyria and lets players explore a vast persistent world alone or with friends.

Instead of the standard MMO trope of allowing players to queue up an out-of-control number of quests with no sense of overarching purpose, the Secret World focuses on a small number of quests at a time with clearly defined goals. The game’s narrative is emphasized by narrowing the focus, and its writing and atmosphere are showcased, which is of a fairly uniform high quality.</p><h4 id="4-Star-Conflict-1"><a href="#4-Star-Conflict-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

The MMO industry generates 10 billion dollars a year and reaches audiences much larger than that. You can find plenty of both free MMORPG games and paid MMORPG’s. World of Warcraft, for example, has players who have cumulatively spent more time on Azeroth than the human species has existed on this planet for 6 million years. The underlying idea behind all these big numbers is a simple one: anyone, anywhere, can become anything in this virtual world (and grind out some loot along the way).</p><p>Unlike the text-based multi-user dungeons from which MMOs evolved, today’s MMOs are incredibly sophisticated. These games offer the best of the genre, be it as humanoid cats or as ruthless dictators. We’ve rounded up the best online games you can play today to celebrate that awesome lineage—and help you find the one that is worth your time. To make things simpler, we’ve also categorized them to give you a good idea of what makes each game exceptional. Also, we will share a list of free MMORPG games, so you don’t need to worry about paying anything to play these games.</p><p> You can check <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Clicker Games to Kill time&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-World-of-Warcraft-3"><a href="#1-World-of-Warcraft-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

So why is it listed? You can play the first 20 levels of the game for free, and since 20 levels mean a lot of time in World of Warcraft, you should have no problem playing it all. It is for this reason that it has been included on this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/world-of-warcraft-poster.jpg"                      alt="world-of-warcraft-poster"                ></p><p>There are not many people who are unfamiliar with the world of Warcraft. It’s a game that’s synonymous with the MMORPG genre. It offers players an expansive, ever-expanding universe filled with content to discover. All the elements of a quality MMORPG are present in this game, such as character customization, a persistent open world, and a compelling storyline. Getting started with World of Warcraft should be your top priority if you haven’t done so already. A game like this shouldn’t be missed.</p><h4 id="2-Guild-Wars-2-3"><a href="#2-Guild-Wars-2-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Guild Wars 2"></a><strong>2. Guild Wars 2</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Another free MMORPG for beginners to start with, Guild Wars 2, has an interesting storyline that changes based on your decisions. You won’t find that in other games of its kind. As with most other MMORPGs, the game includes general features like character customization, crafting, and strong PvP and PvP elements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/guild-wars-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>It takes place in the fantasy world of Tyria and lets players explore a vast persistent world alone or with friends.

The game is defined at least partly by its setting, which is the stuff of conspiracy theory crackpots’ dreams (or their worst nightmares). A world shrouded in mystery and filled with supernatural horrors is characterized by secret societies, mythological creatures, and evil cults. This game’s events are given a dramatic sweeping sweep by some killer sound design, which effectively amps up the tension.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/secret-worlds-legends-poster.jpg"                      alt="Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>The game’s dedication to storytelling is one of its strongest features. Instead of the standard MMO trope of allowing players to queue up an out-of-control number of quests with no sense of overarching purpose, the Secret World focuses on a small number of quests at a time with clearly defined goals. The game’s narrative is emphasized by narrowing the focus, and its writing and atmosphere are showcased, which is of a fairly uniform high quality.</p><h4 id="4-Star-Conflict-3"><a href="#4-Star-Conflict-3" class="headerlink" title="4.
