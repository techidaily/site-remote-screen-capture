It is <strong>cost-effective</strong>, <strong>very reliable,</strong> and offers <strong>the best image quality for its price range.</strong> Although the C920 doesn’t have a few of the add-ons the C922 has, you can be confident that you’re still getting a fantastic camera. It excels at all the basic requirements, with <strong>impressive video quality</strong> <strong>at 1080p</strong>.</p><p>While there are a lot of other webcams that can stream 1080p HD videos, most can only stream in 1080p at the cost of a lowered frame rate. The footage they produce will be high-resolution, but the video will appear sluggish. What really sets Logitech’s C920 apart is its ability to stream 1080p video with a <strong>framerate of 30 FPS</strong> with no framerate reduction.</p><p>If you are looking for the best bang for your buck, the C920 is the one for you.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Dependable video quality in 180p, to rival more expensive webcams</li><li>Long cord</li><li>Built-in hardware compression to maintain stream quality</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Doesn’t have the add-ons of the C922</li><li>Audio is occasionally muffled</li></ul><h4 id="2-The-Best-Premium-Webcam-for-Twitch-Streaming-Logitech-C922"><a href="#2-The-Best-Premium-Webcam-for-Twitch-Streaming-Logitech-C922" class="headerlink" title="2.

It has all the features of the C920 with a bit extra. The C922 can stream <strong>at 60 FPS in 720p</strong>; and has a <strong>noticeable upgrade in image quality in low-lighting</strong>. This can be especially useful if you are streaming without a lighting set-up. The C922 also has a <strong>background replacement feature</strong> which you might have seen being used by some of your favorite Twitch streamers.</p><p>However, the background removal feature is software powered and the higher processor load can lead to lag.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Fantastic video quality with 60 FPS at 720p and 30 FPS at 1080</li><li>Excellent low-light self-correction</li><li>Background replacement feature designed for live streaming games</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Background replacement can lead to performance issues</li><li>Limited audio quality compared to external mics</li><li>Cost</li></ul><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Record Twitch Stream <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="3-The-Best-New-Webcam-for-Twitch-Livestreaming-Razer-Kiyo"><a href="#3-The-Best-New-Webcam-for-Twitch-Livestreaming-Razer-Kiyo" class="headerlink" title="3.

The Best New Webcam for Twitch Livestreaming: Razer Kiyo</h4><p>If you are new to Twitch live streaming you might not have an elaborate lighting setup like some of the more popular streamers. As a lot of streamers know, adding even minor lighting to your streams can make so much difference. That’s where the brand-new <a class="link"   href="https://amzn.to/3gyCKqJ" >Razer Kiyo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes in. The Kiyo has a <strong>modern aesthetic</strong>, with <strong>twelve white LED lights in a ring formation around the lens</strong>.</p><p>The lights are adjustable with 12 different brightness settings. Razer consulted Twitch streamers in developing this camera, so it’s one of the few on the market <strong>designed specifically for you</strong>.</p><p>The Kiyo is in the same price bracket as the C922, and like the C922 it gives you <strong>60 FPS at 720p and 30 FPS at 1080p</strong>. However, compared to the mics on the Logitech C920 and C922, the Kiyo has shown to underperform.</p><p>We have reviewed the Razer Kiyo webcam in details, you can check <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Razer Kiyo webcam review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Built for Twitch streamers</li><li>Forward-thinking LED lighting</li><li>Excellent image quality at 720p and 1080p</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Native mic audio quality is not as high as comparable cams</li><li>Cost</li></ul><h4 id="4-The-Best-Cheap-Webcam-for-Twitch-Livestreaming-Microsoft-LifeCam-Cinema"><a href="#4-The-Best-Cheap-Webcam-for-Twitch-Livestreaming-Microsoft-LifeCam-Cinema" class="headerlink" title="4.

It has a <strong>maximum resolution of 720p</strong>, with <strong>HD video up to 30 FPS</strong>. It sits on a <strong>360-degree swivel mount</strong> and the <strong>TrueColor Technology</strong> automatically boosts the image quality of the broadcast.</p><p>Like the Kiyo, the LifeCam’s mic underperforms compared to some of the other webcams, sometimes allowing background noise through that other mics would cancel.

Logitech has upped its game with this webcam, allowing streamers to produce <strong>professional-quality videos</strong>. The 4K Pro is packed with additional features. Including <strong>infrared facial recognition</strong>, <strong>5x digital zoom</strong>, <strong>90-degree field of vision,</strong> and <strong>RightLight with HDR</strong> for recording in low-light environments.</p><p>Unfortunately, the webcam’s clip is a step down from those on the C920 and the C922, and it doesn’t hold the camera tight against the display. Although, if you can put up with that then the 4K Pro takes the best shots you’ll find right now, if you have the software to support 4K.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Beautiful 4K images</li><li>Works well in low-light</li><li>Great sound quality</li><li>90-degree field of vision</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>The clip doesn’t hold tight against displays</li><li>Cost</li></ul><p>We have reviewed the Logitech 4K Pro Webcam in details, you can check the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Logitech 4K Pro webcam complete review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The overriding sentiment seems to be if in doubt choose Logitech! The Logitech C920 remains a firm fan-favorite for Twitch streamers, but the C922 is an impressive upgrade. With some Twitch streamers now making upwards of $5000 a month, you might want to be investing in a serious piece of kit.</p><p>In that case, go for the Logitech 4K Pro. It might have an annoying clip but there is just nothing else like it on the market now. At the other end of the scale, the Microsoft LifeCam is always a good choice and the Razer Kiyo is one to keep your eyes on!</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best free webcam video recording software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948881/19272" target="_top" id="1948881">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948881" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948881/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Software-for-Webcam-Video-Recording-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Best-Software-for-Webcam-Video-Recording-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Best Software for Webcam Video Recording: Wondershare Filmora"></a>Best Software for Webcam Video Recording: Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Many people want to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record webcam videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for streaming, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >gameplay <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, tutorial and more, then Filmora <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will be the best choice to opt.

Most events are broadcasted live, although On-Demand webinars or Evergreen webinars as they are sometimes referred to, allow you to use the existing material and simulate the live broadcast experience.</p><p>Live meetings online in which a single person or several speakers discuss, present or demonstrate a certain topic, information or a product are called webinars. The audience of a webinar varies from a single person up to 5.000 people depending on the purpose and the software that is being used for the production of a webinar. This process may sound daunting at first, but with time and experience, you’ll come to realize why most online marketers think that webinars are the second most effective b2b marketing strategy.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?</h2><p>A web-based seminar is run by a presenter, a person who provides information relevant to the webinar’s topic to attendees. In order to record a webinar, you’ll need a computer that is equipped with a webcam, a pair of headphones and a microphone, or you can use a Smartphone as an alternative. Most webinar software products offer tools that enable the presenter to insert all types of documents, draw on the screen and use other methods of explaining the topic to the viewers.</p><p>Participants can ask questions, post comments or even speak during a webinar if they are granted permission, and the presenter can answer questions or explain some aspects of the topic in more detail. Once the session is over, all participants of a webinar receive a video recording so they can rewatch it or go through the parts of the session they’ve missed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?"></a>Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?</h2><p>Besides the hardware, you will also need the proper software to set up your first webinar. Even though live streaming is possible without the use of software products that are optimized for webinar creation, most computer programs for production of webinars offer powerful tools that broaden the range of things you can do while broadcasting.</p><p>A well-rounded webinar software enables you to set up a registration page, chat with participants or use pop-up windows that allow attendees to purchase the products or services you’re offering. However, the key ingredient of any powerful webinar software are the metrics tools that let you monitor user engagement and other statistics that are important to the success of your webinars.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657400/16446" target="_top" id="1657400">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657400" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657400/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars"><a href="#Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars"></a>Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars</h2><p>On-demand and live webinars can cover a wide range of topics that have different objectives.

Tutorial Webinar"></a>1. Tutorial Webinar</h4><p>This is probably the most popular type of a webinar because tutorials help people solve problems and accomplish things they struggled with. Your webinars can show viewers how they can perform color grading on their videos, build a dog house for their children or make a delicious ice cream, the options are unlimited. The only prerequisite is to be really good at what you are explaining, since talking about topics you don’t know much about, can hardly lead you to success.</p><h4 id="2-Tech-Training-Webinar"><a href="#2-Tech-Training-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="2. Tech Training Webinar"></a>2. Tech Training Webinar</h4><p>Technology and software are developing at an astounding rate, so most of us are having trouble to keep up with all the latest apps and software products that emerge on the market almost on a daily basis. You can use a webcam, a screen recorder or any type of camera to teach others how to use apps, software or any other modern technology.</p><h4 id="3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits"><a href="#3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits" class="headerlink" title="3. Reviews and Website Audits"></a>3. Reviews and Website Audits</h4><p>A lot of small brands and companies are struggling when it comes to online presentation, which is the reason why creating a webinar that offers in-depth analysis of their blog, website or sales page can prove to be very useful to the participants of your webinars. What’s more, you can offer constructive critique of almost anything, as long as it is relevant to the target group you’re addressing.</p><h4 id="4-Software-Demonstrations"><a href="#4-Software-Demonstrations" class="headerlink" title="4. Software Demonstrations"></a>4. Software Demonstrations</h4><p>Companies that manufacture software as well as individuals who consider themselves experts for a particular software can create webinars that demonstrate how a computer program is used properly. Even the high-end professionals encounter problems while using a software, which means that your audience can include inexperienced and skilled users.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135315/14409" target="_top" id="2135315">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2135315" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135315/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software"></a>Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software</h2><p>The decision to start producing webinars shouldn’t be taken lightly, because creating a successful webinar is anything but an easy task. You should do everything in your power to approach this task prepared since a simple mistake can ruin a lot of work.</p><h4 id="1-Define-Your-Goals"><a href="#1-Define-Your-Goals" class="headerlink" title="1. Define Your Goals"></a>1. Define Your Goals</h4><p>Being successful requires you to know your goals, so before you start producing webinars you have to define what you want to accomplish and work on it patiently. Masterclasses, One-On-One sessions in which you share your expertise or customer training webinars can all be on the list of your objectives, but you should only make webinars that are directly related to your area of expertise.</p><h4 id="2-Target-Audience"><a href="#2-Target-Audience" class="headerlink" title="2. Target Audience"></a>2. Target Audience</h4><p>Who is your ideal webinar attendee? How old is this person, and where do they live? These are some of the questions that might help you define your target audience and adjust the content of your webinar to the level of skills and knowledge an ideal participant of your webinar has. Knowing who your audience is, will also help you establish a stronger bond with the attendees of the webinars you are producing.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-the-Right-Software"><a href="#3-Choose-the-Right-Software" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose the Right Software"></a>3. Choose the Right Software</h4><p>The type of webinar you want to create will point you in the direction of the best webinar software for the job. Simple online applications like Google + Hangouts or Facebook Live can be a perfect solution if you’re looking for an efficient and easy way to broadcast your content live, but if you are more interested in the production of On-Demand webinars then Zoom or GoToWebinar platforms are a much better choice for you.</p><h4 id="4-Pricing"><a href="#4-Pricing" class="headerlink" title="4. Pricing"></a>4. Pricing</h4><p>Most professional webinar software are expensive, and if you have no intention of using the advanced features they offer, then there is no reason to invest in them.

A good webinar software offers features that make the process of creating a webinar smooth while enabling you to focus on the quality of the content you’re producing. Here are a few options that make a webinar software great.</p><h4 id="1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools"><a href="#1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools" class="headerlink" title="1. The Content Authoring Tools"></a>1. The Content Authoring Tools</h4><p>Setting up webinar registration pages, chatting with the participants of your webinar or selling products during a webinar are just a few among many authoring tools you will need to make your presentations look professional. The webinar software that doesn’t provide a rich selection of content authoring tools may limit your possibilities and reduce the maximum reach a webinar can have.</p><h4 id="2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems"><a href="#2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems" class="headerlink" title="2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems"></a>2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems</h4><p>Numbers matter. A scientific approach to webinars will enable you to stay ahead of the competition and to keep track of how well your content is performing. Besides powerful tools for measuring metrics a good webinar software should also offer social media integrations, so you can reach even more people who might be interested in what your webinars have to offer.</p><h4 id="3-Interactivity"><a href="#3-Interactivity" class="headerlink" title="3. Interactivity"></a>3. Interactivity</h4><p>Being able to communicate with your audience, through live chat or video messages and to respond to each question they might have will improve your chances to make a sale or to develop a loyal fan-base that follows each of your webinars. Some webinar hosting platforms allow you to have more than just one speaker, so webinar attendees can share their opinions and feel more involved in the discussion that is taking place.</p><h4 id="4-Branding-or-White-Labeling"><a href="#4-Branding-or-White-Labeling" class="headerlink" title="4. Branding or White Labeling"></a>4. Branding or White Labeling</h4><p>A good webinar software should help you raise brand awareness. You should be able to add logos to everything you offer through your webinars, use the brand’s colors or even include the brand’s promo materials in a webinar. Customizing webinars will help you fans recognize your work, but putting too much accent on the promotion of your brand can come across as too aggressive, so it is important to find the right measure in branding and white labeling.</p><p>Creating webinars is not a complicated process, but it does require preparation. The information we provided above should help you find the right webinar software that will enable you to produce visual content of the highest quality.</p><h2 id="Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars"><a href="#Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars"></a>Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars</h2><p>Staying ahead of your competition and keeping pace with all the latest technology trends is essential if your goal is to conquer new markets or to lead teams that have great chemistry. Only a few decades ago, it was impossible to hold a conference video call that included more than thirty people, while online training courses were regarded as science fiction. The Internet, webcams, and screen capturing software have changed all this, and today we can easily produce software walk-throughs, eLearning content and a wide variety of video content that enables us to establish strong relationships with potential clients.</p><p>Choosing the webinar software that is capable of meeting all of your demands might be more challenging than it seems because there are thousands of webinar software products available. That’s the reason why we’ve put together the list of the ten best webinar software products, so let’s dive in and explore the premier options for bloggers, entrepreneurs and everyone else who wants to create webinars.</p><table><thead><tr><th>App Name</th><th>Best For</th><th>Pricing</th><th>Platform</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Google + Hangouts</td><td>Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>YouTube Live</td><td>Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook Live</td><td>Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</td><td>Free</td><td>iOS, Android</td></tr><tr><td>WebinarJam</td><td>Selling products during a webinar, live chat with participants of a webinar</td><td>$39,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>EverWebinar</td><td>On-Demand Webinars</td><td>$41 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GoToWebinar</td><td>Large marketing teams</td><td>Plans start at $89</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Zoom</td><td>Educators, large companies, marketing teams</td><td>$14,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Livestorm</td><td>Analytics oriented marketers</td><td>$99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>ClickMeeting</td><td>In-company meetings, all types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $25</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GetResponse</td><td>All types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $49</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h4 id="1-Google-Hangouts"><a href="#1-Google-Hangouts" class="headerlink" title="1. Google + Hangouts"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://hangouts.google.com/" >Google + Hangouts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>The Google’s product lets you invite as many as thirty participants to a webinar, and if you want, you can also broadcast the webinar on YouTube Stream. All broadcasting sessions are recorded and stored on the YouTube channel you used to broadcast a webinar, and the owner of the channel can make the video private or public. However, the Google + Hangouts app has gone through a lot of changes over the last few years, and on March 9, 2017, Google has announced that it will divide Hangouts into two products, Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet.</p><p>Companies that employ large numbers of people often use Google + Hangouts because it enables more than one participant of the webinar to speak and because new members can easily join the webinar. This app isn’t perfectly suited for commercial use since it doesn’t allow you to set a fee for joining the event.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> A great tool for webinars that have a lot of participants, especially if there are several speakers. The app lets you upload webinars to YouTube and share them effortlessly.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Creating paid events or keeping track of the metrics is not on the list of options Google + Hangouts offers, and you need to create an account on Google before you can join a webinar.</p><h4 id="2-YouTube-Live"><a href="#2-YouTube-Live" class="headerlink" title="2. YouTube Live"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/my%5Flive%5Fevents" >YouTube Live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>YouTube is the largest online video sharing platform in the world that offers most of its services for free. The YouTube Live feature enables its users to stream live footage captured with screen recording software or webcams and to invite as many viewers to their webinars as they want. Anyone who has a link can join the broadcast, but replying to messages and comments viewers post during a webinar is needlessly complicated.</p><p>Besides, making communication with the participants of a webinar almost impossible, YouTube Live also doesn’t feature a lot of marketing tools that can boost the sales of the products you’re offering. To make things even worse, your broadcasts may have a lag that can be as long as 40 seconds, so paying attention to how you set up your webinars can be crucial for their success.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to use and enables even the most inexperienced vloggers, eLearning content creators, and marketers to produce and share webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited interaction with viewers as well as the lack of advanced features for marketing products make YouTube Live only suitable for newcomers to the world of webinars.</p><h4 id="3-Facebook-Live"><a href="#3-Facebook-Live" class="headerlink" title="3. Facebook Live"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://apps.facebook.com/livestream/" >Facebook Live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>Facebook, like many popular social media networks, has integrated live streaming into the services it provides. Besides enabling you to create webinars, Facebook Live also lets its users produce any other type of live stream, but only with a Smartphone. The conventional webcam method of recording webinars is not available on Facebook Live, and the app doesn’t offer any features for customization of webinars.</p><p>The number of people watching your live stream cannot surpass the number of friends you have on your Facebook account, which means that you can’t use this app to reach new clients. However, if you have a loyal fan-base on this social network, Facebook Live can help you develop a better relationship with people who already follow your work. Even though creating webinars with Facebook Live is possible, professionals will be better off using some more powerful webinar software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Anyone who has a Facebook account can install and use Facebook Live for free, to capture handheld footage for their webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> No other features besides the live streaming option and you can’t record webinars with a webcam.</p><h4 id="4-WebinarJam"><a href="#4-WebinarJam" class="headerlink" title="4.

WebinarJam also provides features such as pop-ups that let you sell products and services while the webinar is in progress. This and countless other options make WebinarJam platform a perfect tool for marketing teams. Some pricing plans offer you to have up to 3 webinars per month that have five hundred participants, while the content sharing capabilities are nothing short of impressive regardless of the pricing plan you choose.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Makes engaging the audience look easy through a rich selection of powerful tools that enable you to interact with viewers of your webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Pricey, and novice users may experience a steep learning curve</p><h4 id="5-EverWebinar"><a href="#5-EverWebinar" class="headerlink" title="5.

Educators, online marketers, and bloggers who want to create a strong bond with their audience should strive to offer something different and unique. Webinars have been largely accepted as one of the most efficient ways of establishing personal contact with the people interested in a particular subject or a product presented in the webinar. However, webinar software is also frequently used to improve internal communication within a team or a company or to train the newcomers and introduce them to the daily tasks on their new job.</p><p>Having a great idea for a webinar is just the first step in the process of creating successful visual content that generates profits, and in this guide, we are going to take you through each step of the process of choosing not only the best but the right webinar software that will meet all of your demands, and we will also introduce some of the best webinar software that you can use for different occasions.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >8 Best Open Source Video Conferencing Software for Enterprise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a href="#section1">Section 1: Brief Intro about Webinar and how to choose Webinar software</a></li><li><a href="#section2">Section 2: Top 10 Best Webinar Software in 2024 [Free &amp; Paid] </a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134240/18498" target="_top" id="2134240">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134240" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="540" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134240/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-A-Webinar"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-A-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is A Webinar?"></a>Part 1: What Is A Webinar?</h2><p>Any video that includes a person (Presenter) explaining a certain problem or presenting services and products to an active or passive audience can be regarded as a webinar. Most events are broadcasted live, although On-Demand webinars or Evergreen webinars as they are sometimes referred to, allow you to use the existing material and simulate the live broadcast experience.</p><p>Live meetings online in which a single person or several speakers discuss, present or demonstrate a certain topic, information or a product are called webinars. The audience of a webinar varies from a single person up to 5.000 people depending on the purpose and the software that is being used for the production of a webinar. This process may sound daunting at first, but with time and experience, you’ll come to realize why most online marketers think that webinars are the second most effective b2b marketing strategy.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?</h2><p>A web-based seminar is run by a presenter, a person who provides information relevant to the webinar’s topic to attendees. In order to record a webinar, you’ll need a computer that is equipped with a webcam, a pair of headphones and a microphone, or you can use a Smartphone as an alternative. Most webinar software products offer tools that enable the presenter to insert all types of documents, draw on the screen and use other methods of explaining the topic to the viewers.</p><p>Participants can ask questions, post comments or even speak during a webinar if they are granted permission, and the presenter can answer questions or explain some aspects of the topic in more detail. Once the session is over, all participants of a webinar receive a video recording so they can rewatch it or go through the parts of the session they’ve missed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?"></a>Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?</h2><p>Besides the hardware, you will also need the proper software to set up your first webinar. Even though live streaming is possible without the use of software products that are optimized for webinar creation, most computer programs for production of webinars offer powerful tools that broaden the range of things you can do while broadcasting.</p><p>A well-rounded webinar software enables you to set up a registration page, chat with participants or use pop-up windows that allow attendees to purchase the products or services you’re offering. However, the key ingredient of any powerful webinar software are the metrics tools that let you monitor user engagement and other statistics that are important to the success of your webinars.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars"><a href="#Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars"></a>Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars</h2><p>On-demand and live webinars can cover a wide range of topics that have different objectives. Education and promotion are the most common reason to produce a webinar, so here are a few ideas that can help you choose the subject of your first webinar:</p><h4 id="1-Tutorial-Webinar"><a href="#1-Tutorial-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="1. Tutorial Webinar"></a>1. Tutorial Webinar</h4><p>This is probably the most popular type of a webinar because tutorials help people solve problems and accomplish things they struggled with. Your webinars can show viewers how they can perform color grading on their videos, build a dog house for their children or make a delicious ice cream, the options are unlimited. The only prerequisite is to be really good at what you are explaining, since talking about topics you don’t know much about, can hardly lead you to success.</p><h4 id="2-Tech-Training-Webinar"><a href="#2-Tech-Training-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="2. Tech Training Webinar"></a>2. Tech Training Webinar</h4><p>Technology and software are developing at an astounding rate, so most of us are having trouble to keep up with all the latest apps and software products that emerge on the market almost on a daily basis. You can use a webcam, a screen recorder or any type of camera to teach others how to use apps, software or any other modern technology.</p><h4 id="3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits"><a href="#3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits" class="headerlink" title="3. Reviews and Website Audits"></a>3. Reviews and Website Audits</h4><p>A lot of small brands and companies are struggling when it comes to online presentation, which is the reason why creating a webinar that offers in-depth analysis of their blog, website or sales page can prove to be very useful to the participants of your webinars. What’s more, you can offer constructive critique of almost anything, as long as it is relevant to the target group you’re addressing.</p><h4 id="4-Software-Demonstrations"><a href="#4-Software-Demonstrations" class="headerlink" title="4. Software Demonstrations"></a>4. Software Demonstrations</h4><p>Companies that manufacture software as well as individuals who consider themselves experts for a particular software can create webinars that demonstrate how a computer program is used properly. Even the high-end professionals encounter problems while using a software, which means that your audience can include inexperienced and skilled users.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software"></a>Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software</h2><p>The decision to start producing webinars shouldn’t be taken lightly, because creating a successful webinar is anything but an easy task. You should do everything in your power to approach this task prepared since a simple mistake can ruin a lot of work.</p><h4 id="1-Define-Your-Goals"><a href="#1-Define-Your-Goals" class="headerlink" title="1. Define Your Goals"></a>1. Define Your Goals</h4><p>Being successful requires you to know your goals, so before you start producing webinars you have to define what you want to accomplish and work on it patiently. Masterclasses, One-On-One sessions in which you share your expertise or customer training webinars can all be on the list of your objectives, but you should only make webinars that are directly related to your area of expertise.</p><h4 id="2-Target-Audience"><a href="#2-Target-Audience" class="headerlink" title="2. Target Audience"></a>2. Target Audience</h4><p>Who is your ideal webinar attendee? How old is this person, and where do they live? These are some of the questions that might help you define your target audience and adjust the content of your webinar to the level of skills and knowledge an ideal participant of your webinar has. Knowing who your audience is, will also help you establish a stronger bond with the attendees of the webinars you are producing.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-the-Right-Software"><a href="#3-Choose-the-Right-Software" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose the Right Software"></a>3. Choose the Right Software</h4><p>The type of webinar you want to create will point you in the direction of the best webinar software for the job. Simple online applications like Google + Hangouts or Facebook Live can be a perfect solution if you’re looking for an efficient and easy way to broadcast your content live, but if you are more interested in the production of On-Demand webinars then Zoom or GoToWebinar platforms are a much better choice for you.</p><h4 id="4-Pricing"><a href="#4-Pricing" class="headerlink" title="4. Pricing"></a>4. Pricing</h4><p>Most professional webinar software are expensive, and if you have no intention of using the advanced features they offer, then there is no reason to invest in them. However, if you want to sell products, draw on the screen during a webinar or keep track of the user engagement statistics for each webinar you produce, investing in the right webinar software may prove to be essential for the success of your webinars.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094429/7443" target="_top" id="2094429">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094429" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094429/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?"></a>Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?</h2><p>There are a lot of factors that should be taken into consideration when trying to determine whether or not the webinar software meets the industry standards. A good webinar software offers features that make the process of creating a webinar smooth while enabling you to focus on the quality of the content you’re producing. Here are a few options that make a webinar software great.</p><h4 id="1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools"><a href="#1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools" class="headerlink" title="1. The Content Authoring Tools"></a>1. The Content Authoring Tools</h4><p>Setting up webinar registration pages, chatting with the participants of your webinar or selling products during a webinar are just a few among many authoring tools you will need to make your presentations look professional. The webinar software that doesn’t provide a rich selection of content authoring tools may limit your possibilities and reduce the maximum reach a webinar can have.</p><h4 id="2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems"><a href="#2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems" class="headerlink" title="2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems"></a>2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems</h4><p>Numbers matter. A scientific approach to webinars will enable you to stay ahead of the competition and to keep track of how well your content is performing. Besides powerful tools for measuring metrics a good webinar software should also offer social media integrations, so you can reach even more people who might be interested in what your webinars have to offer.</p><h4 id="3-Interactivity"><a href="#3-Interactivity" class="headerlink" title="3. Interactivity"></a>3. Interactivity</h4><p>Being able to communicate with your audience, through live chat or video messages and to respond to each question they might have will improve your chances to make a sale or to develop a loyal fan-base that follows each of your webinars. Some webinar hosting platforms allow you to have more than just one speaker, so webinar attendees can share their opinions and feel more involved in the discussion that is taking place.</p><h4 id="4-Branding-or-White-Labeling"><a href="#4-Branding-or-White-Labeling" class="headerlink" title="4. Branding or White Labeling"></a>4. Branding or White Labeling</h4><p>A good webinar software should help you raise brand awareness. You should be able to add logos to everything you offer through your webinars, use the brand’s colors or even include the brand’s promo materials in a webinar. Customizing webinars will help you fans recognize your work, but putting too much accent on the promotion of your brand can come across as too aggressive, so it is important to find the right measure in branding and white labeling.</p><p>Creating webinars is not a complicated process, but it does require preparation. The information we provided above should help you find the right webinar software that will enable you to produce visual content of the highest quality.</p><h2 id="Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars"><a href="#Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars"></a>Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars</h2><p>Staying ahead of your competition and keeping pace with all the latest technology trends is essential if your goal is to conquer new markets or to lead teams that have great chemistry. Only a few decades ago, it was impossible to hold a conference video call that included more than thirty people, while online training courses were regarded as science fiction. The Internet, webcams, and screen capturing software have changed all this, and today we can easily produce software walk-throughs, eLearning content and a wide variety of video content that enables us to establish strong relationships with potential clients.</p><p>Choosing the webinar software that is capable of meeting all of your demands might be more challenging than it seems because there are thousands of webinar software products available. That’s the reason why we’ve put together the list of the ten best webinar software products, so let’s dive in and explore the premier options for bloggers, entrepreneurs and everyone else who wants to create webinars.</p><table><thead><tr><th>App Name</th><th>Best For</th><th>Pricing</th><th>Platform</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Google + Hangouts</td><td>Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>YouTube Live</td><td>Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook Live</td><td>Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</td><td>Free</td><td>iOS, Android</td></tr><tr><td>WebinarJam</td><td>Selling products during a webinar, live chat with participants of a webinar</td><td>$39,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>EverWebinar</td><td>On-Demand Webinars</td><td>$41 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GoToWebinar</td><td>Large marketing teams</td><td>Plans start at $89</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Zoom</td><td>Educators, large companies, marketing teams</td><td>$14,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Livestorm</td><td>Analytics oriented marketers</td><td>$99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>ClickMeeting</td><td>In-company meetings, all types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $25</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GetResponse</td><td>All types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $49</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h4 id="1-Google-Hangouts"><a href="#1-Google-Hangouts" class="headerlink" title="1. Google + Hangouts"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://hangouts.google.com/" >Google + Hangouts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>The Google’s product lets you invite as many as thirty participants to a webinar, and if you want, you can also broadcast the webinar on YouTube Stream. All broadcasting sessions are recorded and stored on the YouTube channel you used to broadcast a webinar, and the owner of the channel can make the video private or public. However, the Google + Hangouts app has gone through a lot of changes over the last few years, and on March 9, 2017, Google has announced that it will divide Hangouts into two products, Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet.</p><p>Companies that employ large numbers of people often use Google + Hangouts because it enables more than one participant of the webinar to speak and because new members can easily join the webinar. This app isn’t perfectly suited for commercial use since it doesn’t allow you to set a fee for joining the event.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> A great tool for webinars that have a lot of participants, especially if there are several speakers. The app lets you upload webinars to YouTube and share them effortlessly.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Creating paid events or keeping track of the metrics is not on the list of options Google + Hangouts offers, and you need to create an account on Google before you can join a webinar.</p><h4 id="2-YouTube-Live"><a href="#2-YouTube-Live" class="headerlink" title="2. YouTube Live"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/my%5Flive%5Fevents" >YouTube Live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>YouTube is the largest online video sharing platform in the world that offers most of its services for free. The YouTube Live feature enables its users to stream live footage captured with screen recording software or webcams and to invite as many viewers to their webinars as they want. Anyone who has a link can join the broadcast, but replying to messages and comments viewers post during a webinar is needlessly complicated.</p><p>Besides, making communication with the participants of a webinar almost impossible, YouTube Live also doesn’t feature a lot of marketing tools that can boost the sales of the products you’re offering. To make things even worse, your broadcasts may have a lag that can be as long as 40 seconds, so paying attention to how you set up your webinars can be crucial for their success.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to use and enables even the most inexperienced vloggers, eLearning content creators, and marketers to produce and share webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited interaction with viewers as well as the lack of advanced features for marketing products make YouTube Live only suitable for newcomers to the world of webinars.</p><h4 id="3-Facebook-Live"><a href="#3-Facebook-Live" class="headerlink" title="3. Facebook Live"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://apps.facebook.com/livestream/" >Facebook Live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>Facebook, like many popular social media networks, has integrated live streaming into the services it provides. Besides enabling you to create webinars, Facebook Live also lets its users produce any other type of live stream, but only with a Smartphone. The conventional webcam method of recording webinars is not available on Facebook Live, and the app doesn’t offer any features for customization of webinars.</p><p>The number of people watching your live stream cannot surpass the number of friends you have on your Facebook account, which means that you can’t use this app to reach new clients. However, if you have a loyal fan-base on this social network, Facebook Live can help you develop a better relationship with people who already follow your work. Even though creating webinars with Facebook Live is possible, professionals will be better off using some more powerful webinar software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Anyone who has a Facebook account can install and use Facebook Live for free, to capture handheld footage for their webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> No other features besides the live streaming option and you can’t record webinars with a webcam.</p><h4 id="4-WebinarJam"><a href="#4-WebinarJam" class="headerlink" title="4. WebinarJam"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://www.webinarjam.com/" >WebinarJam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Selling products during a webinar, live chat with participants of a webinar</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Pricing plans start at $39,99 per month billed annually</p><p>The web-based platform is designed to work seamlessly on any web-browser and any device, so its users won’t have to worry about the quality of their webinars. WebinarJam can be used for a wide array of different purposes including, Q&amp;As, presenting products or chatting with your fans. What’s more, as many as six co-presenters can speak in a single webinar, which makes WebinarJam an excellent option for roundtables and open debates about important topics.</p><p>This tool for the production of webinars enables you to capture high-definition footage, and it automatically records each session. WebinarJam also provides features such as pop-ups that let you sell products and services while the webinar is in progress. This and countless other options make WebinarJam platform a perfect tool for marketing teams. Some pricing plans offer you to have up to 3 webinars per month that have five hundred participants, while the content sharing capabilities are nothing short of impressive regardless of the pricing plan you choose.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Makes engaging the audience look easy through a rich selection of powerful tools that enable you to interact with viewers of your webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Pricey, and novice users may experience a steep learning curve</p><h4 id="5-EverWebinar"><a href="#5-EverWebinar" class="headerlink" title="5. EverWebinar"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.everwebinar.com/1t60/" >EverWebinar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> On-demand Webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $41 per month, billed annually</p><p>WebinarJam and EverWebinar were developed by the same team, although the two platforms offer somewhat different options. The EverWebinar is designed to facilitate and simplify the process of rebroadcasting On-demand webinars. Small and up-and-coming brands that can profit from replaying webinars that were already recorded, will find EverWebinar’s services perfectly optimized for this task.</p><p>You can schedule a new rebroadcasting session effortlessly and simulate the look and feel of the original webinar while increasing the user engagement by making the videos available for a limited amount of time.

Frame drop is a common issue if you are using OBS Studio for recording high-end games or live streaming with high output resolution. You can easily understand about OBS drop frames while streaming when your viewers complain about lagging and stuttering.</p><p>In fact, you can even check OBS stream status to find out about OBS Studio drop frames. Dropping frames literally ruins the recording and hence, it needs to be fixed before further operation. You need to understand the reasons behind OBS losing frames and take actions accordingly to fix the issue. In this article, we will explain the reasons and provide all the possible solutions to prevent OBS dropping frames recording and streaming.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-OBS-Drops-Frames"><a href="#Part-1-Why-OBS-Drops-Frames" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why OBS Drops Frames?"></a><strong>Part 1. Why OBS Drops Frames?</strong></h2><p>OBS can drop the frame rate due to various reasons. When too many frames are dropped, the streaming server is disconnected. Dropped frames are one of the main causes which can affect streaming playback. Besides, a drop in frames leads to bad recording of screen and gameplay. Here are some of the reasons why OBS drops frames while recording or streaming.</p><ul><li>Your computer has an unstable internet connection.</li><li>Your computer has low-end hardware configuration.</li><li>Your video output resolution is very high.</li><li>Your video bitrate is very high.</li><li>Your internet upload speed is rather low.</li><li>antivirus or firewall is messing with OBS Studio.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Fix-OBS-Dropping-Frame"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Fix-OBS-Dropping-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Reduce The Output Resolution"></a>Way 2. Reduce The Output Resolution</h2><p>When you reduce the resolution, the video quality gets lowered. But for smooth streaming and recording, you have no other option. When you reduce resolution, you require less CPU usage and less internet bandwidth. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Video tab. You will see Base and Output resolution.</p><p>Step 3: You have to reduce Output Resolution from the current or default setting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-output-resolution.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the output resolution"                ></p><p>Step 4: Click Apply for saving the changes followed by Ok button.</p><h2 id="Way-3-Reduce-The-Video-Bitrate"><a href="#Way-3-Reduce-The-Video-Bitrate" class="headerlink" title="Way 3. Reduce The Video Bitrate"></a>Way 3. Reduce The Video Bitrate</h2><p>OBS generally does not maintain a specified bitrate. It keeps on changing the bitrate as per the available condition like CPU usage level and bandwidth and speed of internet connection. When there are constant changes in the bitrate, there is a likelihood of stuttering effect. Even though it has come up with Dynamic bitrate which will automatically reduce the bitrate, but it increases the bitrate when there is no congestion. You can reduce the bitrate by going through these steps.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS Studio and click on Settings button.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and look for Video Bitrate option.</p><p>Step 3: Lower the video bitrate from the default or current value.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and OK button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-video-birate.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the video birate"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135368/19272" target="_top" id="2135368">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135368" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135368/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Way-4-Change-OBS-Process-Priority"><a href="#Way-4-Change-OBS-Process-Priority" class="headerlink" title="Way 4.

Change OBS Process Priority</h2><p>By changing the OBS process priority from Normal to Above Normal, there could be more processing power availability for OBS Studio. It helps in solving the problem of frame drop by driving performance from the system for better encoding and rendering. Here are the steps for changing OBS process priority.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Advanced tab and look for Process Priority.</p><p>Step 4: You will have to change it to ‘Above Normal’ from ‘Normal’.</p><p>Step 5: Click Apply followed by Ok button.</p><h2 id="Way-5-Update-Network-Driver"><a href="#Way-5-Update-Network-Driver" class="headerlink" title="Way 5. Update Network Driver"></a>Way 5. Update Network Driver</h2><p>Dropped frame rates can happen due to the outdated network adapter driver. For this, it is important to look for the latest version of the driver. With up-to-date drivers, there will be a smooth connection when you are streaming or playing online games. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: From Start menu, search for Device Manager and open it.</p><p>Step 2: Find Network Adapters and click on it to expand.</p><p>Step 3: Find your LAN card and right-click on it.</p><p>Step 4: From the menu, select Update Driver option.</p><p>Follow the onscreen instruction to complete the process and restart your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/device-manager-update-network-driver-2.jpg"                      alt="device manager update network driver"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139122/17108" target="_top" id="2139122">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139122" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139122/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Way-6-Turn-Off-Your-Firewall-and-Antivirus"><a href="#Way-6-Turn-Off-Your-Firewall-and-Antivirus" class="headerlink" title="Way 6.

It can interfere with the internet connection leading to dropping frames. Similarly, antivirus software messes with any third-party software and prevents regular operations. You have to temporarily turn off real-time protection as well as the antivirus software. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Start menu and search for Firewall.</p><p>Step 2: Open Firewall &amp; Network Protection.</p><p>Step 3: Turn off firewall for domain, private and public network temporarily to fix dropping frame issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/turn-off-your-firewall-and--antivirus.jpg"                      alt="turn off your firewall and antivirus"                ></p><p>Step 4: Go to Virus &amp; Threat Protection.</p><p>Step 5: Under Virus &amp; Threat Protection section.

It keeps on changing the bitrate as per the available condition like CPU usage level and bandwidth and speed of internet connection. When there are constant changes in the bitrate, there is a likelihood of stuttering effect. Even though it has come up with Dynamic bitrate which will automatically reduce the bitrate, but it increases the bitrate when there is no congestion. You can reduce the bitrate by going through these steps.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS Studio and click on Settings button.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and look for Video Bitrate option.</p><p>Step 3: Lower the video bitrate from the default or current value.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and OK button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-video-birate.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the video birate"                ></p><h2 id="Way-4-Change-OBS-Process-Priority-3"><a href="#Way-4-Change-OBS-Process-Priority-3" class="headerlink" title="Way 4.

Microsoft’s PowerPoint program for Windows comes with various customization options for creating a presentation. In addition to text, you can place images, tables, charts, videos, links, and other types of content in your PowerPoint presentation to really make it pop.</p><p>There have been complaints from PowerPoint users about not being able to have direct access to the full detail of the presentation after presenting. One of the most prominent problems is that users want to jot things down, and at the same time, they want to pay full attention to the presenter especially when the presentation is on ‘how to’. There is a tendency to miss little vital information. Also, those who miss presentations on PowerPoint have no hope of getting the presentation in detail.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a solution to the problem. Recording PowerPoint as a video is possible. It is an interesting and helpful idea that could help users go over the whole presentation and get the information as though the PowerPoint presentation is still live. The only difference will be the time at which they watched the presentation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-1.jpg"                      alt="how to record a powerpoint presentation"                ></p><p>This article will:</p><ol><li>Educate you on how to record PowerPoint presentations with video and audio, in a step-by-step approach.</li><li>Show you the benefits of recording PowerPoint presentations.</li><li>Teach you the advantages and disadvantages of using PowerPoint presentations with video and audio</li><li>Recommend a third-party tool to record PowerPoint presentations.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-I-When-you-will-need-to-record-a-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-I-When-you-will-need-to-record-a-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part I. When you will need to record a PowerPoint?"></a>Part I. When you will need to record a PowerPoint?</h2><p>There are almost 35 million PowerPoint presentations delivered daily.</p><p>PowerPoint slides are the preferred method of delivering supplementary information that enables audiences to comprehend and relate to the concepts and ideas delivered in presentations, whether in classrooms or boardrooms. Presentations can take several forms, including</p><ul><li>Training and tutorials</li><li>Business and sales presentations</li><li>Executive communications</li><li>Product demos</li><li>Educational lectures</li><li>Student assignments</li><li>And more…</li></ul><p>But after they are delivered, what happens to all of those PowerPoint slides? Depending on the content and target audience, a select few will be shared or preserved, either publicly on SlideShare or privately on SharePoint.</p><p>In most cases, PowerPoint slides on their own, without the corresponding presentation — are incomplete and don’t do the best job of communicating the concepts from the actual presentation. Those ahead of the curve should be to share and archive recordings of their full presentations.</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-to-record-a-PowerPoint-presentation-with-video-and-audio"><a href="#Part-II-How-to-record-a-PowerPoint-presentation-with-video-and-audio" class="headerlink" title="Part II. How to record a PowerPoint presentation with video and audio"></a>Part II. How to record a PowerPoint presentation with video and audio</h2><p>You can record a presentation in real-time as you present, or do it in advance to leverage the flipped model or make your presentation available on-demand.</p><p>While there are several ways to record a presentation, this is one of the easiest ways to record a high-quality presentation in PowerPoint with audio and video.</p><h5 id="Step1-Prepare-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Talking-Points"><a href="#Step1-Prepare-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Talking-Points" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Prepare Your PowerPoint Slides and Talking Points"></a>Step1 Prepare Your PowerPoint Slides and Talking Points</h5><p>Before recording your presentation, ensure your slides are organized correctly and error-free. The function of your PowerPoint presentation is to act as a visual aid for the information you’re presenting, not to present all your information for you. Don’t put too much info on your slides so you won’t be tempted to read directly from them.</p><p>The image below shows how your screen will look when your presentation is ready.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-2.jpg"                      alt="prepare your powerpoint slides and talking points"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Select-Your-Audio-and-Video-Sources"><a href="#Step2-Select-Your-Audio-and-Video-Sources" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Select Your Audio and Video Sources"></a>Step2 Select Your Audio and Video Sources</h5><p>You can record video, audio, or just your slide show directly within the Microsoft PowerPoint program. After you’ve opened PowerPoint, select “Recording” from the top navigation bar. This will open a new navigation bar with “Record Slide Show” and “Screen Recording” options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-3.jpg"                      alt="select your audio and video sources"                ></p><p>If you just want to record your slideshow without adding audio or video, you would select “Record Slide Show”. Choosing “Screen Recording” will let you capture your slideshow while at the same time recording audio from your computer and any video on your computer screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> you can start recording from the beginning or you choose a current slide to start recording from.</p><h5 id="Step3-Open-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Capture-the-Screen"><a href="#Step3-Open-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Capture-the-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Open Your PowerPoint Slides and Capture the Screen"></a>Step3 Open Your PowerPoint Slides and Capture the Screen</h5><p>Choose “Screen Recording,” and you’ll be given the opportunity to select the area on your screen you want to capture. Adjust the red box to fit your Powerpoint presentation. Once you have the box where you want it, you’re ready to record!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-4.jpg"                      alt="open your powerpoint slides and capture the screen"                ></p><h5 id="Step4-Press-Record-And-Start-Presenting"><a href="#Step4-Press-Record-And-Start-Presenting" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Press Record And Start Presenting"></a>Step4 Press Record And Start Presenting</h5><p>Make sure the “Audio” button appears gray before you hit the record button. Once you hit record, you’ll begin capturing everything in the area you’ve selected, and any audio picked up by your computer’s mic.</p><p>If you prefer, you can skip recording audio during this step and add it later. Use the “Audio” option from the PowerPoint navigation if you’re trying to find out how to record PowerPoint presentations with audio you’ve already recorded.</p><h5 id="Step5-Export-the-video-to-achieve-this-follow-the-steps-below"><a href="#Step5-Export-the-video-to-achieve-this-follow-the-steps-below" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Export the video: to achieve this, follow the steps below"></a>Step5 Export the video: to achieve this, follow the steps below</h5><ol><li>Navigate to File, click Export, and choose to Create a Video</li><li>Select the resolution</li><li>Set timing parameters or use recorded timings and narration</li><li>Click on Create Video</li><li>Choose Save as Type and select between MPEG-4 or Windows Media Video</li></ol><p><strong>Pros and Cons of Using PowerPoint to Record Your Presentation</strong></p><p>Consequently, using PowerPoint to record your presentation has some advantages and disadvantages.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Easy to create with free resources</li><li>Works great for doing web-based tutorials</li><li>Works great for step-by-step explanations</li><li>Create homework help, how-to’s, problem&#x2F;solution videos, and visual presentations that mark up on the screen</li><li>you can both create the presentation within the program and convert it into a video on the spot</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>PowerPoint isn’t a video editing tool.
