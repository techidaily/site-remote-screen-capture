About OBS Studio</h2><p>Here are all the details of OBS Studio that you will help you compare OBS with Streamlabs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-pros-and-cons.jpg"                      alt="obs pros and cons"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136618/26400" target="_top" id="2136618">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136618" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136618/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Performance:</p><p>OBS Studio is designed for multi-tasking. You can live stream as well as record your video. You can capture your screen as well as webcam video simultaneously. In fact, it supports capturing video from various external devices. For regular video recording and streaming, the performance of OBS is top-notch. It does not affect the performance of your streaming or gameplay.</p><p>However, when you have extremely high-quality video playing on your screen or you are playing high-end games that you want to record, OBS Studio tends to consume excessive CPU resources. Therefore, OBS Studio is suitable for regular quality streaming and recording and it might crash if your computer configuration is not top-notch.</p><p>Recording:</p><p>If you are comparing OBS vs Streamlabs for recording, OBS is a clear winner. This is because OBS Studio heavily focuses on recording features while Streamlabs focuses on live streaming broadly. You can record video from any external device, you can modify recording quality, and you can switch between multiple scenes as required. It also comes with filters for color correction, chroma key, and masking for better recording.</p><p>Streaming:</p><p>OBS Studio is the most popular live streaming platform and this is due to its wide compatibility. Once you have Stream URL and Stream key, you can literally stream on any and all online platforms that allow live streaming. Starting from Twitch, YouTube and Facebook to even Instagram and Twitter, you can stream on all popular and not-so-popular platforms directly from your desktop.</p><p>Ease Of Use:</p><p>OBS can be a bit complicated to use for beginners. This is because the user interface is not as clean and intuitive as you would expect. However, once you start using the software for some time, you will get used to the controls and options. But the learning curve is rather steep and that is why many users opt for OBS alternatives. For ease of use, OBS Studio has loads of hotkeys through which you can perform all the different operations instantly.</p><p>Video Quality:</p><p>OBS Studio lets you customize the video quality as per your requirements. You can capture 4K video depending on your screen resolution or camera resolution. However, OBS automatically lowers the frame rate as the resolution of the video goes up which is not desirable. That is why users do not prefer OBS for recording 4K videos and mostly use it for standard, high-definition video quality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123472/16836" target="_top" id="2123472">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123472" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123472/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h3><ul><li>Compatible with Windows, Linux, and MacOS.</li><li>Wide range of compatibility for live streaming.</li><li>Customizable settings from different specifications.</li><li>Work with multiple scenes and input sources.</li><li>Pushes latest updates for improved performance.</li></ul><h3 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h3><ul><li>Does not have user-friendly interface.</li><li>Excessive CPU usage and frequent crashes.</li><li>Not very suitable for 4K video quality.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136621/26400" target="_top" id="2136621">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136621" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136621/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-About-Streamlabs-Desktop"><a href="#2-About-Streamlabs-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="2.

This Android OS was released in 2013, and it is the first OS for Android Smartphones that enabled its users to create screen recordings, although only via the Android Developer SDK, with the help of Android Debug Bridge. Furthermore, this option only works if the device is connected to a computer, and you also need to have access to the phone’s Developer mode.</p><p>One year after the KitKat OS was introduced to the public Google developed a new version of the Android OS, popularly named Lolipop, which allowed users to record their Smartphone’s screen with an app. The name Lollipop refers to versions 5.0 and 5.1.1 of the Android OS, and in February 2018, 24,6% of all Android devices accessing Google Play had the Lollipop OS. The more recent versions of Android OS, like Android ‘Marshmallow’, also provide support for screen recording apps.</p><p>If you have Lollipop or Marshmallow OS installed on your Android Smartphone, you can use the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rivulus.screenrecording&hl=en" >Lollipop Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, although plenty more screen recording apps are available on the Google Play. Let’s have a look at the steps you’ll need to take in order to figure out how to record your screen on your Android phone with Lollipop Screen Recorder.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder"></a>Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder</h4><p>Open the Google Play application on your phone and search for the Lollipop Screen Recorder app. You can download it for free, so after the installation of the app is complete, launch it and proceed to adjust the settings for your screen recording session.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings"><a href="#Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings"></a>Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Lollipop Screen Recorder features only three settings, that let you choose whether you want to shoot in Landscape or Portrait mode, change the resolution of the video recording and enable the audio recording feature.</p><p>It is important to pay attention to the size of the file you are producing, especially if you want to send it to someone because if you pick the maximum Recording Resolution, the video file of your screen recording is going to be huge. Tutorials in which you show how an app is used or how to fix a certain problem on an Android Phone can benefit from the Record Microphone Audio option because it will enable you to explain the steps with your voice.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device"><a href="#Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device"></a>Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-start-recording.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Now that you’ve adjusted all the settings for a screen recording session, you should click on the circular icon located in the upper right corner of the app.</p><p>After you tap on the icon a message will pop up on the screen informing you that the app is about to start a new screen recording session. Check the Don’t show again checkbox and proceed to tap on the Start Now button. Once the screen recording session is in progress, you can leave the Lollipop Screen Recorder app and perform all activities you wanted to capture with your Android Smartphone.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session"><a href="#Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session" class="headerlink" title="Step 4  Finishing the recording session"></a>Step 4  Finishing the recording session</h4><p>The app’s notification bar is going to be located at the top of the Smartphone’s screen, during the screen recording session, so in order to stop recording you simply need to find the notification with the label ‘Recording Screen’ and press stop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-recorded-file.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Go back to the Lollipop Screen Recorder and you’ll be able to find the video file in the app’s main window. You can play the video directly from the Lollipop Screen recorder or you can share it to your Gmail account directly from the app. If you don’t like the screen recording you made, you can tap on the Delete button and start a new session.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Amazingly easy to use and it lets you capture videos in Portrait and Landscape modes.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Lollipop Screen Recorder can only capture screens in the device’s native resolution, and it doesn’t provide any customization options.</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Find out more video recorders for Android Phones and Tablets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><hr><h2 id="Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen"></a>Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen</h2><p>Using an app to record the screen of your Android smartphone is just one method in which this task can be accomplished.

Although they are frequently used to capture the gameplay of a video game, capture cards can also be used to capture a screen on an Android Smartphone.</p><p>These external video adapters let you connect the Android device and a computer, although you’ll have to spend some time to properly set up a screen recording session with a capture card. Some capture cards can cost as much as $200, so if you want to utilize this method to capture a screen on your Android Smartphone you should be prepared to invest money in such a project.</p><p>But the cost is the only downside of this otherwise very effective method of recording a screen on an Android device. The amount of options capture cards offer is staggering, but before you start recording a screen on your Smartphone you must make sure that you have the right hardware and software equipment.</p><p>What if this also doesn’t work for you? Don’t give up. You still stand a chance if your android device has an HDMI port. You can connect your device to a digital video camera and do the recording. Failing this, your solution will depend on a PC with HDMI PCI Express card or a USB HDMI adaptor powered with a suitable video capture software.</p><p>Sometimes you shouldn’t depend on installing apps. With the help of a ROM flasher, you can get a screen recorded included in your devices ROM. Therefore, if you already have a custom ROM running on your device, better to have a look if a screen recorder is installed.

Key Features of SplitCam"></a>2. Key Features of SplitCam</h2><p>Even though it is a completely free video recorder, there are loads of useful features for the users. Here are the key features of SplitCam that you should be aware of.</p><p>Record From Different Sources – You can record webcam video, desktop screen, IP camera, web browser screen, as well as your gameplay. Besides, you can record audio from different sources. In fact, you can record another video, image, PDF document, slideshow, and much more in the background.</p><p>Video Effects – There are loads of video effects available to apply to webcam videos. Besides, there are realistic 3D masks available, and you can replace heads and faces with 3D objects. This will enhance the video content and allow you to create fun videos.</p><p>Live Streaming: With Splitcam, you can live stream to different video services like Justin.tv, UStream, and Livestream instantly. Besides, SplitCam allows you to use webcam with several applications without any issue. You can also upload your video to YouTube instantly.</p><p>Useful Features: The zoom feature is really great for highlighting the needed part. When you are making explanatory video, the zooming feature is a necessity for everyone to focus on the right part. Besides, you can capture screenshots instead of video as well. The software also shows the performance parameters for better understanding.</p><p>HD recording – SplitCam lets you record the desired video from any video source as per the video resolution you need. The software supports up to 2048x1536 video resolution. You can adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpen, and other parameters to enhance the video quality.</p><p>Moreover, you can use hotkeys to operate the software smoothly, and the user interface is quite simple and easy to operate.</p><h2 id="3-In-depth-Review"><a href="#3-In-depth-Review" class="headerlink" title="3. In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4.

With just one click, the host of the meeting can also mute everyone in the session so there are no extra sounds or distractions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115908/19272" target="_top" id="2115908">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115908" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115908/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Mute-Your-Microphone-in-Google-Meet"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Mute-Your-Microphone-in-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Mute Your Microphone in Google Meet?"></a>Part 2: How to Mute Your Microphone in Google Meet?</h2><p>While many believe using the mute feature on Google Meet is a tricky task, the question of <strong>how to mute a Google Meet</strong> is fairly simple.</p><p>All an individual has to do is click the microphone button located on the bottom of their screen and they will be muted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-microphone-on-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet Mute"                ></p><p>If they click that same button again, they will be unmuted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unmute-yourself-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet unmute"                ></p><p>However, if they do not want to make use of the screen to mute and unmute, they can use keyboard key shortcuts.

Netflix is a streaming service that allows you to subscribe and view movies and TV episodes on your internet-connected devices. With over 222 million customers by the start of 2022, Netflix is likely one of the most popular video streaming services. Netflix will never be boring you with its vast selection of fascinating TV episodes and movies, including action, thrillers, and comedies. This is why Netflix has become everyone’s favorite and we can’t get enough of it. Netflix does, however, have certain limits.</p><p>When you go on a vacation and don’t have access to Wi-Fi, you can have trouble viewing your subscription program when it airs. When it comes to screen recording Netflix, there’s always the issue of whether or not it’s legal. In most cases, the term “illegal” is used to denote a criminal law infringement. Recording and viewing copyrighted works for personal use rather than commercial objectives is not deemed a copyright violation, according to the regulation. You won’t be able to view Netflix when your membership expires. Although Netflix allows you to download some movies with tiles, they may be withdrawn from the Netflix channel before you begin binge viewing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098701/14409" target="_top" id="2098701">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098701" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098701/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Method-1-Use-QuickTime-to-Record-Netflix"><a href="#Method-1-Use-QuickTime-to-Record-Netflix" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use QuickTime to Record Netflix"></a>Method 1: Use QuickTime to Record Netflix</h2><p>You may use the QuickTime Player to record Netflix episodes on your Mac.

Netflix has added a download function that enables you to save TV shows to your smartphone for offline watching. However, the capability is not available for desktop users, and what’s more, these downloads expire as well. So that’s how simple it is to record Netflix videos. Netflix movies may be recorded in a variety of file formats, including MP4, WMV, AVI, 3GP, and others.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1516822341?pt=169436&ct=pc-article-top50&mt=8"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images2022/download-mac-store.png"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134243/18498" target="_top" id="2134243">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134243" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134243/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Steps-to-Record-Netflix-with-Filmora-–-The-Easiest-Solution-3"><a href="#Steps-to-Record-Netflix-with-Filmora-–-The-Easiest-Solution-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Record Netflix with Filmora – The Easiest Solution"></a>Steps to Record Netflix with Filmora – The Easiest Solution</h3><p> 1.

The emulator runs on C++ and is designed to emulate the Nintendo Switch’s essential hardware components. function.

This is useful when you want to record your screen, show your face, and give your commentary. Besides, you can also record your screen with internal audio or mic audio without a webcam. Therefore, go for a screen recorder with audio online and webcam capture.</p><p>User-Friendly Interface - The overall interface of the online screen recorder for PC has to be intuitive and user-friendly. This means you should be able to record with a minimum number of steps. Besides, customizing the settings should be easy, and the download option should be readily available.
