This Android OS was released in 2013, and it is the first OS for Android Smartphones that enabled its users to create screen recordings, although only via the Android Developer SDK, with the help of Android Debug Bridge. Furthermore, this option only works if the device is connected to a computer, and you also need to have access to the phone’s Developer mode.</p><p>One year after the KitKat OS was introduced to the public Google developed a new version of the Android OS, popularly named Lolipop, which allowed users to record their Smartphone’s screen with an app. The name Lollipop refers to versions 5.0 and 5.1.1 of the Android OS, and in February 2018, 24,6% of all Android devices accessing Google Play had the Lollipop OS. The more recent versions of Android OS, like Android ‘Marshmallow’, also provide support for screen recording apps.</p><p>If you have Lollipop or Marshmallow OS installed on your Android Smartphone, you can use the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rivulus.screenrecording&hl=en" >Lollipop Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, although plenty more screen recording apps are available on the Google Play.

However, if you want to use ADB you’ll first need to go through the setup process, and even add it to the Windows System PATH.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enabling-the-ADB"><a href="#Step-1-Enabling-the-ADB" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enabling the ADB"></a>Step 1: Enabling the ADB</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-android-screen-via-computer.jpg"                      alt=" Record Android Screen via Computer"                ></p><p>Locate the SDK’s installation folder on your PC, and click on the ADB option in the Platform Tools menu.

That doesn’t necessarily mean that you can’t record video with older android devices.<br>In such cases you can use android SDK to mirror the device’s display and record it using a desktop screen-capture software. Mirroring Software will enable you to record the screen on an Android device without rooting. You can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-screen-mirror/" >Wondershare MirrorGo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> software to mirror cast the screen from your mobile phone to a display on your computer. Here’s how to record your screen on Android without rooting.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Install-Wondershare-MirrorGo"><a href="#Step-1-Install-Wondershare-MirrorGo" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Install Wondershare MirrorGo"></a>Step 1: Install Wondershare MirrorGo</h4><p>Start the process of setting up your screen recording session by downloading the MirrorGo Android recorder software for free from the manufacturer’s website. Launch the software and connect your Android Smartphone to the MirrorGo. You’ll be able to see the screen of your Android device on the PC’s screen. The software will synchronize all actions between two displays.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Record-the-Screen"><a href="#Step-2-Record-the-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Record the Screen"></a>Step 2: Record the Screen</h4><p>Locate the Android Recorder button, and click on it to commence the screen recording session. You can play mobile video games or create a detailed tutorial on how to use a certain Android app.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Complete-the-recording-and-access-the-video-file"><a href="#Step-3-Complete-the-recording-and-access-the-video-file" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Complete the recording and access the video file"></a>Step 3: Complete the recording and access the video file</h4><p>Click on the Android Recorder button to stop the session, and once the screen capturing process is finished, a pop window on your Smartphone’s screen will notify you that your video is saved and it will also show you the location on which the file was saved on your computer.</p><hr><h3 id="Method-3-Capture-Screen-on-Android-with-Capture-Card"><a href="#Method-3-Capture-Screen-on-Android-with-Capture-Card" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Capture Screen on Android with Capture Card"></a>Method 3: Capture Screen on Android with Capture Card</h3><p>Capture Cards are devices that enable you to record screens on a wide range of different devices including X-box or PS4. Although they are frequently used to capture the gameplay of a video game, capture cards can also be used to capture a screen on an Android Smartphone.</p><p>These external video adapters let you connect the Android device and a computer, although you’ll have to spend some time to properly set up a screen recording session with a capture card. Some capture cards can cost as much as $200, so if you want to utilize this method to capture a screen on your Android Smartphone you should be prepared to invest money in such a project.</p><p>But the cost is the only downside of this otherwise very effective method of recording a screen on an Android device. The amount of options capture cards offer is staggering, but before you start recording a screen on your Smartphone you must make sure that you have the right hardware and software equipment.</p><p>What if this also doesn’t work for you? Don’t give up. You still stand a chance if your android device has an HDMI port. You can connect your device to a digital video camera and do the recording. Failing this, your solution will depend on a PC with HDMI PCI Express card or a USB HDMI adaptor powered with a suitable video capture software.</p><p>Sometimes you shouldn’t depend on installing apps. With the help of a ROM flasher, you can get a screen recorded included in your devices ROM. Therefore, if you already have a custom ROM running on your device, better to have a look if a screen recorder is installed. If so, it is a matter of activating it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-navigating-through-luts-for-improved-photography-techniques/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Navigating Through LUTs for Improved Photography Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/024-approved-optimal-screen-reproduction-system-for-youtubing-adepts/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Optimal Screen Reproduction System for YouTubing Adepts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-artisans-guide-to-backdrop-free-image-perfection-with-photopea/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Artisan's Guide to Backdrop-Free Image Perfection with Photopea</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-handpicked-selections-ringtones-directly-from-snap/"><u>[New] Handpicked Selections  Ringtones Directly From Snap</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-methodology-to-purging-your-youtube-watch-later-playlist/"><u>[New] Methodology to Purging Your YouTube Watch Later Playlist</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-craft-the-ultimate-outro-with-pro-maker-advice/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Craft the Ultimate Outro with Pro Maker Advice</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-exclusive-high-end-computer-choices/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Exclusive High-End Computer Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-acclaimed-software-rankings-top-10-phonepc-video-calls/"><u>2024 Approved  Acclaimed Software Rankings  Top 10 Phone/PC Video Calls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-apeaksoft-screen-recorder-review/"><u>2024 Approved  Apeaksoft Screen Recorder Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-7-first-person-shooters-of-the-year/"><u>2024 Approved  Best 7 First-Person Shooters of the Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-elevate-your-gaming-advanced-techniques-for-recording-minecraft/"><u>2024 Approved  Elevate Your Gaming  Advanced Techniques for Recording Minecraft</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-essential-guide-recording-video-calls-on-pctablet/"><u>2024 Approved  Essential Guide  Recording Video Calls on PC/Tablet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-optimize-your-cellphones-camera-settings-for-videography/"><u>2024 Approved  How to Optimize Your Cellphone's Camera Settings for Videography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-share-screen-on-skype-when-working-from-home/"><u>2024 Approved  How to Share Screen on Skype When Working From Home</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-podcasting-tech-updates-unveiled/"><u>2024 Approved  Podcasting Tech Updates Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ranking-the-most-accessible-video-chat-applications-top-10-for-businesses-and-schools/"><u>2024 Approved  Ranking the Most Accessible Video Chat Applications  Top 10 For Businesses & Schools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-scheduling-success-creating-regular-google-meets/"><u>2024 Approved  Scheduling Success  Creating Regular Google Meets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tips-for-embedding-time-stamps-in-youtube-clips/"><u>2024 Approved  Tips for Embedding Time Stamps in YouTube Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-10-screen-capture-tools-for-educators/"><u>2024 Approved  Top 10 Screen Capture Tools for Educators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-the-potential-of-aiseesoft-for-video-documentation/"><u>2024 Approved  Unlocking the Potential of Aiseesoft for Video Documentation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/apowersoft-picks-top-pc-screen-recorder-reviewed-for-2024/"><u>Apowersoft Picks  Top PC Screen Recorder Reviewed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/apowersoft-screen-record-unveiled-top-alternatives-reviewed/"><u>Apowersoft Screen Record Unveiled -

Try Recording if you don’t require a lot of quality, and if it doesn’t enough, you can always move up to High-Quality Recording. Consider the size of the files before using Indistinguishable or Near-Lossless Recording if you require high-quality recordings. Many of the other settings on the Recording panel have to do with bitrate when you go to Advanced. As part of your recording setup, this is essentially the greater the bitrate, the bigger the file size of the video. To avoid pixelated video, it is best to keep the bitrate at a reasonable level.

The next step is to enter your stream key so that Streamlabs OBS may upload your material to the platform for viewing by other subscribers. Click Settings &gt; Stream &gt; and then input your stream key to do this. In the lower right-hand corner, click “Go Live” to begin streaming. If you’re encoding with x264, you’ll have to enter these values by hand. The best bitrate depends on your screen size and set-up, so there isn’t a universal setting that works for everyone.

Alternative Way to Record Computer Screen</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, there’s a difference between OBS and Streamlabs OBS – Streamlabs, such as chat windows and a dashboard, are included. The Streamlabs OBS helps you keep track of your donations and fans. With pre-made themes and templates, it is also easier to incorporate them in a live stream. Non-Streamlabs versions of OBS still support OBS templates, themes, and overlays. But due to its lacking of various features, there’s an alternative to it namely Wondershare Filmora. Both streaming and real-time recording are possible with Filmora screen recorder, which produces HD video quality and is easy to use.

You can use them on virtually every major streaming platform, from Twitch to YouTube to Facebook Gaming and everywhere else. You can create your streaming templates if you are a skilled designer and have access to appropriate graphics software, such as Adobe Photoshop or Fireworks. But for that, we have got a recommendation as mentioned earlier – Filmora solution.
