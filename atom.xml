The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo’s SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.</p><p>With the PS1 emulator for PC, you can play PlayStation 1 games. Play your favorite PlayStation games on your computer with the original BIOS, your own BIOS, and your own games. Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better. All you need is a copy of the disc image.</p><h3 id="1-RetroArch-Emulator"><a href="#1-RetroArch-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="1.RetroArch Emulator"></a>1.RetroArch Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/retroarch-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="retroarch-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>This emulator offers a variety of solutions and is just an emulator for playing PS1 video games, making it one of the best ps 1 emulators and most complete emulators. The first stable version was released in the year 2020, almost a decade after its launch in the year 2010. On top of all that, it is free, open-source, and can emulate gaming consoles, media players, game engines, and others. That makes it a very reliable emulator.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Multiple platforms are supported, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li><li>As a fast, portable, lightweight emulator, RetroArch requires no adjustments or very little tweaking to run and function properly.</li><li>In terms of game-saving, refresh rate, game loading, and screen resolution, it is one of the best PS1 emulators out there.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Matsu-Emulator"><a href="#2-Matsu-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="2.Matsu Emulator"></a>2.Matsu Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/matsu-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="matsu-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>There is also the Matsu Emulator, which is based on the PSX&#x2F;PSOne platform. Despite being one of the best emulators in the world, it is also quite stable and safe. There are more and more features being added to the software. In contrast, the simulator works well but the free version has heavy advertising. If you purchase the pro edition in the game, you will be able to remove the advertisements. If you would like to pay someone for an emulator, we would recommend ePSXe or FPse. You will find Matsu Emulator to be a reliable and efficient program if you can endure its commercials.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>It features an on-screen virtual keypad as well as support for gamepads.</li><li>The sound quality is excellent.</li><li>As well as fast-forwarding, it also supports rewinding.</li><li>Up to 16 slots can be used by the Matsu emulator.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Mednafen"><a href="#3-Mednafen" class="headerlink" title="3.Mednafen"></a>3.Mednafen</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mednafen-poster-ps1.png"                      alt="mednafen-poster-ps1"                ></p><p>Games are run using OpenGL and SDL in Mednafen, a multi-system emulator. Users can remap hotkeys and virtual system inputs to joysticks or keyboards, or both simultaneously. Rewinding in real-time and saving at multiple states are supported by the emulator. It also allows you to take screenshots instantly. Pictures are saved as PNG files.</p><p>The majority of Mednafen’s cores are portions from other applications, but some are originals. In terms of quality, precision, and compatibility, its original cores (built to run PS1, Sega Saturn, and Nintendo Virtual Boy games) are noteworthy. The command-line interface of Mednafen is easy to use. Additionally, it supports several third-party GUIs to make configuration even easier. For example, MedLaunch offers a dynamic games library with DAT lookup and online scraping and the ability to configure controllers.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Multi-platform emulation allows games to be played on PlayStation One as well as other gaming consoles.</li><li>Compatible with most gaming consoles, including the PlayStation One, it is very accurate in its compatibility.</li><li>Providing you have the right PlayStation BIOS and ROM, it can be set up quickly and easily.</li><li>The Mednafen emulator supports the use of game cheats.</li></ul><h3 id="4-ePSXe"><a href="#4-ePSXe" class="headerlink" title="4.ePSXe"></a>4.ePSXe</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/epsxe-ps1-poster.png"                      alt="epsxe-ps1-poster"                ></p><p>You can play PlayStation games on your Android phone and PC using ePSXe (short for enhanced PSX emulator). A wide range of devices are supported, making it a fast, accurate, and highly versatile tool. Within seconds, you can start playing games after configuring the program. It is just a matter of copying the BIOS file from your console, setting up the controller, and customizing the keys.</p><p>Gameplay usually runs smoothly without much configuration and trial-and-error. When your game doesn’t load or you experience lags, you can fix it by applying an ePSXe patch (in .ppf format).</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>This software provides a close analogous experience to playing video games on the PlayStation One itself, but on a personal computer.</li><li>Its controller options can be tailored to meet your needs.</li><li>It allows you to pause, resume, and save your gameplay from the point you last left it.</li><li>Dual-player and split-screen modes are available.

Today, people who want to create a tutorial or a gaming video can produce high-quality video recordings of their desktop screens.</p><p>If you are looking for a fast and inexpensive way to capture your desktop activities, you’ve come to the right place. In this article, we will show you how to <strong>record your desktop screen</strong> with free built-in software on Windows or with some free screen recording software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-desktop-screen.jpg"                      alt="record desktop screen"                ></p><h2 id="Screen-Capture-Record-Screen-vs-Take-Screenshot"><a href="#Screen-Capture-Record-Screen-vs-Take-Screenshot" class="headerlink" title="Screen Capture: Record Screen vs. Take Screenshot"></a>Screen Capture: Record Screen vs. Take Screenshot</h2><p>Before we proceed any further, we must first highlight the distinction between a screenshot and a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

The same shortcut can be used to stop recording. All videos will be saved in the same destination folder named Video&#x2F;Capture, and the app won’t let you change this setting.</p><p>However, the DVR feature in Xbox app will allow you to choose the duration of your video or increase the quality of the video you’re recording but the mouse cursor will not be recorded. Some computers that support Windows 10 will not let you use this app if your video card doesn’t support AMD VCE, Intel Quick Sync H.260, or Nvidia NVENC encoders.</p><h4 id="2-Using-Built-in-MS-PowerPoint-to-Record-Screen-for-free-on-Windows"><a href="#2-Using-Built-in-MS-PowerPoint-to-Record-Screen-for-free-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="2.

To start the recording session, you simply have to launch PowerPoint and head over to the <strong>‘Insert’</strong> tab.</p><p>Locate the <strong>Screen Recording</strong> button and once you click on it, proceed to click on the ‘<strong>Select Area</strong>‘ option that will enable you to designate the area of the screen you want to record. If you would like to capture an entire screen, hold the Windows, SHIFT, and F keys simultaneously. After you’ve made the selection simply hit the <strong>Record</strong> button to initiate the screen recording session.</p><p>The screen recording options MS PowerPoint provides are somewhat limited, which is the reason why this feature should only be used if you have to produce a screen recording in a short time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135350/19272" target="_top" id="2135350">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135350" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135350/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-2-Using-Free-Screen-Recording-Software-to-Capture-Desktop-Screen-on-Windows"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Free-Screen-Recording-Software-to-Capture-Desktop-Screen-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Free Screen Recording Software to Capture Desktop Screen on Windows"></a>Method 2: Using Free Screen Recording Software to Capture Desktop Screen on Windows</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flashback-express-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="Record with PPT"                ></p><p>The built-in software on Windows 10 may be a great way to produce a quick screen recording, but if you want to create professional software walkthroughs, let’s play videos or tutorials then using a free screen recording software such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.flashbackrecorder.com/express/" >FlashBack Express <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a much better option.

However, it is not obvious that you only use Google Meet to participate in the discussion. There can be a situation when you don’t want to join a video session formally yet need to share a presentation. The good news is that you can share your screen and presentation without formal participation in the Google Meet session. The procedure is slightly different from the regular one. Let’s know more about how to share the screen on Google Meet without joining the meeting.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Open-up-Google-Meet-Invite-Link-and-join-in-the-meeting"><a href="#Step-1-Open-up-Google-Meet-Invite-Link-and-join-in-the-meeting" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Open up Google Meet Invite Link and join in the meeting"></a>Step 1: Open up Google Meet Invite Link and join in the meeting</h3><p>Launch the Google Meet website or its application, enter the meeting code or link, or click <strong>start a meeting</strong>.</p><p>Click the Google Meet invite link and then you will see the screen as below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/present-without-participant-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="  Share Screen without join in Google Meet  "                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Share-screen-without-participating"><a href="#Step-2-Share-screen-without-participating" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Share screen without participating"></a>Step 2: Share screen without participating</h3><p>Tap <strong>Present</strong> and select a preferred window to share.

Similarly, you do not need to turn on the camera and microphone if you are using Google Meet on an Android device, as you can directly share the screen instead of joining a meeting on an Android device.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Share-Your-Screen-Using-a-Browser-Other-than-Chrome"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Share-Your-Screen-Using-a-Browser-Other-than-Chrome" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Share Your Screen Using a Browser Other than Chrome"></a>Bonus: How to Share Your Screen Using a Browser Other than Chrome</h2><p>Chrome is not the only way to access video-conferencing tools. There is no exception for Google Meet. So, you can use all its features, and even access it through any other browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. Alongside joining Google Meet, you may also share your screen in Firefox and Internet explorer. Similarly, Opera mini can be used as well to take advantage of the screen sharing feature.
