Frame drop is a common issue if you are using OBS Studio for recording high-end games or live streaming with high output resolution. You can easily understand about OBS drop frames while streaming when your viewers complain about lagging and stuttering.</p><p>In fact, you can even check OBS stream status to find out about OBS Studio drop frames. Dropping frames literally ruins the recording and hence, it needs to be fixed before further operation. You need to understand the reasons behind OBS losing frames and take actions accordingly to fix the issue. In this article, we will explain the reasons and provide all the possible solutions to prevent OBS dropping frames recording and streaming.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-OBS-Drops-Frames"><a href="#Part-1-Why-OBS-Drops-Frames" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why OBS Drops Frames?"></a><strong>Part 1. Why OBS Drops Frames?</strong></h2><p>OBS can drop the frame rate due to various reasons. When too many frames are dropped, the streaming server is disconnected. Dropped frames are one of the main causes which can affect streaming playback. Besides, a drop in frames leads to bad recording of screen and gameplay. Here are some of the reasons why OBS drops frames while recording or streaming.</p><ul><li>Your computer has an unstable internet connection.</li><li>Your computer has low-end hardware configuration.</li><li>Your video output resolution is very high.</li><li>Your video bitrate is very high.</li><li>Your internet upload speed is rather low.</li><li>antivirus or firewall is messing with OBS Studio.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Fix-OBS-Dropping-Frame"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Fix-OBS-Dropping-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How To Fix OBS Dropping Frame?</strong></h2><h2 id="Way-1-Update-OBS-Run-as-an-Administrator"><a href="#Way-1-Update-OBS-Run-as-an-Administrator" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Update OBS &amp; Run as an Administrator"></a>Way 1. Update OBS &amp; Run as an Administrator</h2><p>It is important to know that you are using the latest version of OBS. This helps to prevent encoding overload as well as problems due to stuttering. Make sure that you run OBS as an administrator. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Download and install the latest version of OBS Studio.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Start menu and search for OBS Studio.</p><p>Step 3: Right-click on the OBS icon and select Run As Administrator option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-run-as-an-administrator.jpg"                      alt="obs run as an administrator"                ></p><h2 id="Way-2-Reduce-The-Output-Resolution"><a href="#Way-2-Reduce-The-Output-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Reduce The Output Resolution"></a>Way 2. Reduce The Output Resolution</h2><p>When you reduce the resolution, the video quality gets lowered. But for smooth streaming and recording, you have no other option. When you reduce resolution, you require less CPU usage and less internet bandwidth. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Video tab. You will see Base and Output resolution.</p><p>Step 3: You have to reduce Output Resolution from the current or default setting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-output-resolution.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the output resolution"                ></p><p>Step 4: Click Apply for saving the changes followed by Ok button.</p><h2 id="Way-3-Reduce-The-Video-Bitrate"><a href="#Way-3-Reduce-The-Video-Bitrate" class="headerlink" title="Way 3. Reduce The Video Bitrate"></a>Way 3. Reduce The Video Bitrate</h2><p>OBS generally does not maintain a specified bitrate. It keeps on changing the bitrate as per the available condition like CPU usage level and bandwidth and speed of internet connection. When there are constant changes in the bitrate, there is a likelihood of stuttering effect. Even though it has come up with Dynamic bitrate which will automatically reduce the bitrate, but it increases the bitrate when there is no congestion. You can reduce the bitrate by going through these steps.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS Studio and click on Settings button.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and look for Video Bitrate option.</p><p>Step 3: Lower the video bitrate from the default or current value.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and OK button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-video-birate.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the video birate"                ></p><h2 id="Way-4-Change-OBS-Process-Priority"><a href="#Way-4-Change-OBS-Process-Priority" class="headerlink" title="Way 4. Change OBS Process Priority"></a>Way 4. Change OBS Process Priority</h2><p>By changing the OBS process priority from Normal to Above Normal, there could be more processing power availability for OBS Studio. It helps in solving the problem of frame drop by driving performance from the system for better encoding and rendering. Here are the steps for changing OBS process priority.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Advanced tab and look for Process Priority.</p><p>Step 4: You will have to change it to ‘Above Normal’ from ‘Normal’.</p><p>Step 5: Click Apply followed by Ok button.</p><h2 id="Way-5-Update-Network-Driver"><a href="#Way-5-Update-Network-Driver" class="headerlink" title="Way 5. Update Network Driver"></a>Way 5. Update Network Driver</h2><p>Dropped frame rates can happen due to the outdated network adapter driver. For this, it is important to look for the latest version of the driver. With up-to-date drivers, there will be a smooth connection when you are streaming or playing online games. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: From Start menu, search for Device Manager and open it.</p><p>Step 2: Find Network Adapters and click on it to expand.</p><p>Step 3: Find your LAN card and right-click on it.</p><p>Step 4: From the menu, select Update Driver option.</p><p>Follow the onscreen instruction to complete the process and restart your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/device-manager-update-network-driver-2.jpg"                      alt="device manager update network driver"                ></p><h2 id="Way-6-Turn-Off-Your-Firewall-and-Antivirus"><a href="#Way-6-Turn-Off-Your-Firewall-and-Antivirus" class="headerlink" title="Way 6. Turn Off Your Firewall and Antivirus"></a>Way 6. Turn Off Your Firewall and Antivirus</h2><p>There can be instances where firewalls can block the port for RTMP. It can interfere with the internet connection leading to dropping frames. Similarly, antivirus software messes with any third-party software and prevents regular operations. You have to temporarily turn off real-time protection as well as the antivirus software. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Start menu and search for Firewall.</p><p>Step 2: Open Firewall &amp; Network Protection.</p><p>Step 3: Turn off firewall for domain, private and public network temporarily to fix dropping frame issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/turn-off-your-firewall-and--antivirus.jpg"                      alt="turn off your firewall and antivirus"                ></p><p>Step 4: Go to Virus &amp; Threat Protection.</p><p>Step 5: Under Virus &amp; Threat Protection section.

Unlike other media players, QuickTime Player is not just for playing audio and video files. The application can record the screen on Mac and save the recordings on the hard drive. Therefore, there is no need for any third-party screen recorder for basic recording. However, many users have reported that they <strong>cannot stop QuickTime screen recording</strong> following the standard procedure.</p><p>When the application fails to stop recording, it fails to save the recording as well. Therefore, QuickTime Player keeps recording the screen, and this slows down the Mac as it keeps occupying the system resources. In this article, we will illustrate all the possible ways to QuickTime Player stop screen recording. We will also recommend a better alternative to QuickTime for professional-quality screen recording.</p><h5 id="Filmora-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Filmora-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Screen Recorder"></a>Filmora Screen Recorder</h5><p>Record computer screen and webcam</p><p>Capture system and microphone audio</p><p>Customize the target recording area</p><p>Edit videos with thousands of effects and tools</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="1-Direct-Way-to-Stop-QuickTime-Recording"><a href="#1-Direct-Way-to-Stop-QuickTime-Recording" class="headerlink" title="1.

Use Keyboard Shortcut to Stop QuickTime Recording"></a>2. Use Keyboard Shortcut to Stop QuickTime Recording</h2><p>The best way to operate any screen recorder is by using the keyboard shortcuts. This is because when you record a screen with an application, the overlay bar stays hidden and if you move the mouse cursor to get the overlay bar, the cursor movement also gets recorded.

Learn all the essential elements and steps to record voice over like professionals.</p><p>For every video you come across, the audio part is equally important as the visual part. Even when the visual part is top-notch, if the audio part such as background music and the voice narration is not good enough, you lose interest in the video. Therefore, you have to pay equal attention to the video recording as well as voiceover recording. A voiceover is basically a person speaking in the background as the video is playing along to make proper sense as well as to add more context to the video.</p><p>A voiceover recording can be describing the video, explaining concepts, highlighting important points, and likewise. Generally, a voiceover is added to the video after the video is already recorded. In order to record a good voice over, there are certain essential elements you need to have beforehand. In this article, we will explain why and how to record a voice over and how to make a voice over good to get everyone’s attention and appreciation.</p><h2 id="1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover"><a href="#1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="1. Why To Record A Voiceover?"></a>1. Why To Record A Voiceover?</h2><p>The engagement on a video depends both on how good the video content as well as how good the audio is. The audio in a video is not just about background music. A good voiceover can do wonders in terms of retaining the attention of the viewers as well as showcasing your personality traits.</p><p>A voice over recording is a must when you are making instructional, educational, and informational videos. Imagine watching a tutorial video where there is no voice to explain what is happening on the screen, everyone will leave the video immediately. Therefore, a voiceover essentially explains the video so that everyone can understand and even relate properly.</p><h2 id="2-Essential-elements-for-a-good-voice-over"><a href="#2-Essential-elements-for-a-good-voice-over" class="headerlink" title="2. Essential elements for a good voice over"></a>2. Essential elements for a good voice over</h2><p>You have to ensure that your voice over recording is great from all perspectives. There are certain essential elements that you have to get right in order to make a voice over mediocre to good and even great.</p><p><strong>Audio Clarity</strong></p><p>Every great voiceover has perfect voice quality and comfortable volume. Audiences may find it distracting if the voiceover recording has a muddy and muffled sound. They will definitely miss the important message that you may want to share through the video. Low volume will make people difficult to hear whereas too loud can cause irritation.</p><p>To ensure audio clarity, professionals use voice over recording studio. If you generally record voice over at home, make sure you do it when there is absolute silence in the background. Besides, the mic quality should be top-notch to pick your voice only as close to original and eliminate background noise.</p><p><strong>Pacing of Pitch</strong></p><p>Pacing is the speed of how fast or slow your pitch is. If you go too fast, your audience will not be able to catch you. On the contrary, the slow pace can be boring. It is important to have a natural pace for everyone to understand as well as stay interested. Therefore, maintain a good pace throughout the video but take pauses to add audio effects. Pauses are a part of pacing for allowing the listeners to grab information and for you to breathe properly so that mic does not catch it.</p><p><strong>Vocal Tone</strong></p><p>Vocal tone is about speaking in a pleasant, soothing but natural manner. You need to make sure that the tone has to be engaging but friendly. Sometimes, you may have to fake it but it must not sound fake or boring for the listeners. A proper vocal tone comes with regular practice and experimentation.</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong></p><p>Always make sure that you pronounce every word correctly. The listeners must clearly understand what you speak clearly. Avoid mumbling, over-enunciating, and shouting. At times, you may have to avoid your regional accent to make the audience understand with more clarity. Always ask feedback from listeners to be better at pronouncing certain words.</p><h2 id="3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over"><a href="#3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over" class="headerlink" title="3. How To Record A Voice Over?"></a>3. How To Record A Voice Over?</h2><p>Here are the steps to follow to record voiceover properly like professionals.</p><p><strong>Getting Ready</strong></p><ul><li>Location: Look for a quiet place to work. Professional voice artists opt for a soundproof room to cancel out external noise. However, you can even go for a quiet area where there is no distracting noise. Microphones can pick up ambient noise that will be reflected in the voiceover recording. Apart from human conversations, you will also have to be careful of the sound coming from electronic gadgets such as computer fans.</li><li>Microphone: Look for a top-notch microphone as per your budget. Consider using a pop filter if you are going to use an external mic. It helps to reduce the distracting sounds with certain alphabets as well as the sound of breathing. Among affordable microphones, you may use modern earbuds or headphones with mic that you use for your smartphone. There are many USB microphones available in the market at an affordable value.</li><li>Voiceover Recorder Software: You need a good-quality audio recording software to record voiceover as well as edit the recording as per requirement. There are many free as well as premium audio recording software available in the market today. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as you can record voice over for any video like professionals as well as edit the recording of audio and video in the same software.</li></ul><p><strong>Writing A Proper Script</strong></p><p>The best way to sound professional during a voice over is to use a proper script. When you don’t use a script, then there can be a lot of pauses and you may try to think about what you will have to say next. When you use a script, you have everything planned out beforehand. Besides, you can also practice what to say when you have a script with pointers and even full explanation of each point. Try to read the script many times and be careful of the words and phrases that can be awkward. Adjust the script accordingly so that it will fit perfectly in the recording.</p><p><strong>Performing A Test Recording</strong></p><p>It is always advisable to go for a test recording to ensure that everything is working properly. In a test recording, you don’t have to go for the entire script but just a few paragraphs. Check if the audio is clear, the volume is at the right level, and the recording is seamless. Check the audio quality by using headphones and not computer speakers.</p><p>**<strong>Microphone Placement</strong> - If you keep the microphone too close to the mouth, there will be all kinds of weird sounds including air puffs. Too far placement will make your voice get fainted. The perfect placement should be about 6 to 8 inches from the mouth and it has to be slightly below the chin. Check the test recording carefully as some microphones can pick up sounds from the table and the computer.</p><p><strong>Recording Voice Over</strong></p><p>So by now, you have the video for which you want to record voiceover. You have connected the microphone to your computer. Now, it is time to record your voice over with voice over recorder Wondershare Filmora.

Understand that Stardew Valley is regarded as a simulation role-playing video game. This video game was developed by no one else but Eric Barone. While it was released in February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, it later made its debut in:</p><ul><li>Xbox one</li><li>PlayStation Vita</li><li>iOS</li><li>Android</li><li>MacOS</li><li>Linux, and even;</li><li>PlayStation 4</li></ul><p>Are you wondering what makes this game interesting? Well, players tend to act as a character who takes complete control over their late grandfather’s already dilapidated farm. And, this farm is located in a place known as Stardew Valley. It must be noted that this game is entirely open-ended as it enables players to take on diverse activities. These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.</p><p>For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools. Bear in mind that Stardew Valley has a lot to offer its players. And, the addition of Ginger Island has made the game very popular. Understand that with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, players have begun new farms and are trying to grow tropical produce to make a profit. If you never knew, Stardew Valley Ginger Island is filled with fun activities as well as puzzles.</p><h2 id="Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island"><a href="#Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island" class="headerlink" title="Stardew Valley Ginger Island"></a><strong>Stardew Valley Ginger Island</strong></h2><p>It must be clearly stated that Stardew Valley Ginger Island is where the majority of the new content of Stardew Valley takes place. If you never knew, the 1.5 update of Stardew Valley has a whole lot to offer, ranging from new items, areas, places to build your farm, and even some new characters.</p><p>Above all, Ginger Island is most likely the most significant part of the Stardew Valley 1.5 update. For those who are just starting with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, things may get quite awkward. However, those who already play the Stardew Valley game will be capable of venturing into the quests and solving them. To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island. However, to restore the community center, you will need to create bundles for no one else but the Junimos. The Junimos are found living inside the community center. By creating all the bundles for the Junimos, they will assist you in restoring the community center. When you are done repairing the community center, you will need to be capable of helping Willy fix his already old boat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-location.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-location"                ></p><p>Immediately you meet the requirements of restoring the community center and fixing willy’s boat. When you get to the Ginger Island while playing the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game, you will meet Leo. The first thing to know about Leo is that he is a shy person though he is not interested in the player. As a shy person, he befriends both animals and players subtly. When he befriends you, he can begin considering making a move into town. The move to town will make Leo more accessible. In all, Leo is simply a child that will manage to successfully befriend Jas and Vincent whenever he is fully settled in the new home in the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game.</p><h2 id="Features-in-Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island"><a href="#Features-in-Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island" class="headerlink" title="Features in Stardew Valley Ginger Island"></a><strong>Features in Stardew Valley Ginger Island</strong></h2><p>Some of the intriguing addition players will love in Stardew Valley Ginger Island include:</p><h3 id="1-Volcano-dungeon"><a href="#1-Volcano-dungeon" class="headerlink" title="1.Volcano dungeon"></a>1.Volcano dungeon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-volcano-dungeon.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-volcano-dungeon"                ></p><p>This is regarded as an enormous draw for adventurous players. It is lava-filled, and players will encounter nine new enemies, lots of new items, a shop, and a forge. Please do not mistake the Volcano dungeon for the skull cavern as they fi crib differently. If you want to pass through the Volcano dungeon successfully, you will need to solve some puzzles. Also, you will need to make use of the watering can to traverse the lava successfully.</p><h3 id="2-The-Island-trader"><a href="#2-The-Island-trader" class="headerlink" title="2.The Island trader"></a>2.The Island trader</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-the-island-trader.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-the-island-trader"                ></p><p>Among the first things, every farmer will have on their to-do list is to get a hold of some elements on the Island. You can do this easily in the Stardew Valley Ginger Island if you are ready to put in the work to find the golden walnuts. When you restore the Island farmhouse, you can pay ten golden walnuts to build the trader’s hut. From here, you can purchase tropical crop seeds and any other unique items.</p><h3 id="3-Pirates-and-Mermaids"><a href="#3-Pirates-and-Mermaids" class="headerlink" title="3.Pirates and Mermaids"></a>3.Pirates and Mermaids</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-pirates-and-mermaids.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-pirates-and-mermaids"                ></p><p>Does it surprise you that there are mermaids on the Stardew Valley Ginger Island? Well, these mermaids seem to appear on Ginger Island. Aside from the mermaids, you will find a pirate cove filled with pirates. When you converse with the mermaids and pirates, you can unlock some items for your farm.</p><h3 id="4-Fossil-Donations"><a href="#4-Fossil-Donations" class="headerlink" title="4.Fossil Donations"></a>4.Fossil Donations</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-fossil-donations.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-fossil-donations"                ></p><p>Stardew Valley Ginger Island is the home of lots of fossils as players are expected to dig them up. When they are dug, the fossils are carried to Dr. Snail and further donated. When you complete the fossils, you will be given golden walnuts. The golden walnuts take the role of currency of the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game.</p><h3 id="5-Dig-site"><a href="#5-Dig-site" class="headerlink" title="5.Dig site"></a>5.Dig site</h3><p>It is practically a tropical version of the quarry but with some quirks. You will find a mushroom cave positioned near it. And when you are inside, you will find the NPC, Dr. Snail. Bear in mind that this site is capable of spawning mahogany trees and nodes daily. It makes it suitable for farming. When you free Dr. Snail from this vicinity, the Island field office will be unlocked, and the power to donate fossils will be provided.</p><h3 id="6-New-farm"><a href="#6-New-farm" class="headerlink" title="6.New farm"></a>6.New farm</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-new-farm.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-new-farm"                ></p><p>If you love the tropical vibe of Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you can get to settle there. Though it will take some work, the farm can be successfully set up on the Island so that you can live there.</p><h3 id="7-Qi’s-Walnut-Room"><a href="#7-Qi’s-Walnut-Room" class="headerlink" title="7.Qi’s Walnut Room"></a>7.Qi’s Walnut Room</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-walnut-room.png"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-walnut-room"                ></p><p>For those unaware, Qi is the mysterious figure that had the powers to give out huge rewards in this game. Once you collect up to one hundred walnuts, the room will be wide open with plenty of goodies within it. However, the gems of Qi will have to be earned so that you can buy items from the shop.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>On a general note, it is pertinent to note that Stardew Valley Ginger Island has lots of fun to provide to players.
