It records your activities on your desktop screen, which you can subsequently modify by editing and rearranging the information, as well as adding callouts, notes, and motion to the recordings. You’ll undoubtedly get the job done with a layered timeline and lots of features you won’t find in a typical video editor. ScreenFlow is a program that allows you to record your screen as well as edit videos. The program was created for Mac rather than Windows.

Start your gameplay and start recording on your computer.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-3"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-3" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Hopefully, you have understood how to record videos on PS4. If your gameplay is less than 60 minutes most of the time, you can do the recording with PS4 default screen recorder. However, for professional recording of your gameplay, we recommend you use Filmora to record gameplay on PSA via your computer. You can edit any part of the video and add transitions and video efforts to make it more eye-catching.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

It is open-source software, and all the features are completely free to use. It is also a cross-platform software that you can use across all desktop operating systems. Apart from capturing screen, you can record video from webcam as well. In fact, it supports different external devices for capturing video including capture card for gaming consoles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><p>Besides, you can record video with audio from system as well as external sources. You can live stream on almost every platform using OBS which is why it is so popular among video creators. The software lets you customize all the settings for recording as per your requirements, and you can even edit the recording as per requirements. The only issue with OBS Studio is that its user interface is slightly complicated.</p><p><strong>Recommended System Requirements -</strong></p><ul><li>Supported OS - Windows, Mac, Linux.</li><li>Processor - Dual-core processor or higher.</li><li>RAM - 2 GB or more.</li><li>HDD - 1 GB or more.</li><li>VGA - 800x600, 16 bit color.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-About-Bandicam"><a href="#Part-2-About-Bandicam" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. About Bandicam"></a>Part 2. About Bandicam</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Bandicam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is specially designed for Windows PC users. You can capture high-quality videos as well as retain the quality of the recordings. The advantage of using Bandicam is that it lets you capture video with more compression rate. It lets you record from external sources like PlayStation, webcam, and smartphones. You can even add voice along with the system sound.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bandicam-screen-recorder-for-pc.jpg"                      alt="bandicam screen recorder"                ></p><p>It allows real-time drawing while recording. Bandicam also lets you add your webcam while recording the screen. You can schedule your recording. You can make use of the green screen technique as well. Besides, you can perform the basic editing after recording. In comparison to OBS, it is a highly user-friendly interface for easy operation.</p><p><strong>Recommended System Requirements</strong> <strong>-</strong></p><ul><li>Supported OS - Windows only.</li><li>Processor - Dual-core processor or higher.</li><li>RAM - 1 GB or more.</li><li>HDD - 1 GB or more</li><li>VGA - 800x600, 16 bit color.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Comparison-of-OBS-vs-Bandicam"><a href="#Part-3-Comparison-of-OBS-vs-Bandicam" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam"></a>Part 3. Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam</h2><p>Here is a detailed comparison of OBS Studio and Bandicam that will definitely help you to which video recording software you should opt for.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong></p><p>The user interface is the main difference between the two popular recording applications. The user interface of OBS can be too overwhelming for a beginner. It takes considerable time to get used to and find the required options instantly. In fact, you may have to go through tutorial videos to get a proper grip on the software. Owning to the popularity of OBS Studio, there is no dearth of videos and guides on OBS.</p><p>On the contrary, Bandicam has a straightforward and user-friendly interface. This is one of the main reasons why some users ditch OBS and opt for Bandicam by paying the required price. You can get all the options intuitively and adjust all the parameters of video recording instantly. Even a beginner will feel like a pro while using Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Screen Recording:</strong></p><p>Both the applications are tailor-made for screen recording. In terms of settings and customizing parameters, both the applications have the same offering. However, when it comes to customized screen recording such as capturing a portion of the screen, the operation gets easy with Bandicam thanks to its intuitive controls and options.</p><p>Moreover, there are more options available for better screen recording on Bandicam. The mouse clicks are well highlighted, there are options for real-time drawing, and you can even schedule screen recording. Setting up a webcam along with the screen in addition to system and external audio recording is more convenient on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Game Recording</strong>:</p><p>There is a dedicated option available on Bandicam for game recording. This means setting up your screen and recording parameters is easy on Bandicam when it comes to game recording. On the contrary, there is no dedicated option on OBS and hence, it is the same as recording your screen with OBS. Therefore, in terms of options and easy controls for game recording, Bandicam is a clear winner.</p><p>However, for recording high-end games, you need a considerably high configuration computer for Bandicam. Otherwise, it brings down FPS automatically so that the system does not break down while recording. Besides, for advanced game recording, OBS supports multi-screen recording which is not available on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>Bandicam is a purely video recording software. There is no option available on Bandicam for live streaming on any platform. Therefore, if you are looking for a video recorder where you can live stream as well, Bandicam should not be your choice and you have to opt for OBS Studio.</p><p>OBS Studio is equally popular in the video creator community as a video recorder as well as a live streaming platform. It is hardly as software available like OBS from where you can live stream on so many different online platforms. Once you have the stream URL and stream key, you are good to go for live streaming from your desktop computer.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video"><a href="#Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Alternative Way to Record Screen Video"></a>Part 4. Alternative Way to Record Screen Video</h2><p>If you are not satisfied with OBS for its complicated user interface and you are looking for a better alternative to Bandicam, we recommend Filmora - a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for both PC and Mac. Both OBS and Bandicam have very limited features in editing a video when editing is essential after you record a video. This is where Filmora scores over OBS and Bandicam. You can capture the screen, record video from webcam as well as record audio from different sources.</p><p>It is a professional video editor with loads of options to edit your recorded video and make it crisp and eye-catching. Therefore, it is a value for money product, and that is why Filmora is one of the most preferred applications among beginners and professionals. Here are the steps to record the screen with Filmora.</p><p>Step 1: Download and install Wondershare Filmora. It is available for Windows and Mac. Open Filmora and click on PC Screen option.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>Step 2: Select the recording screen size, the microphone and the system audio. You can turn on Record the Camera Stream option if you want to record webcam along with the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-recording-screen.jpg"                      alt="start screen recording"                ></p><p>Step 3: To start recording, click on Record button. You can press F9 key to stop recording.</p><p>You can then edit the recording and export in the desired file format.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>To sum it up for you, OBS is completely free while Bandicam is a premium software. In terms of features, there is not much difference but Bandicam is significantly use to easy. Bandicam has more options for better screen recording but it lacks useful editing options. If you are looking for a better alternative Bandicam, we recommend Wondershare Filmora and you can record and edit video like a professional.</p><p>Part 1.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Dead-Walkers-Dominance-Leading-Zombie-Video-Game-Ranks"><a href="#Dead-Walkers-Dominance-Leading-Zombie-Video-Game-Ranks" class="headerlink" title="Dead Walkers Dominance: Leading Zombie Video Game Ranks"></a>Dead Walkers Dominance: Leading Zombie Video Game Ranks</h2><p>Which zombie games are the best for PC? It’s difficult to walk down the street on PC without zombie games grabbing at your leg, so it’s a legitimate concern. Don’t write off the genre because there are a few brainless clones - we’ve compiled a list of some of the zombie games to hit PC.</p><p>There are a lot of zombie enemies in the zombie games, and they enjoy eating brains, and there’s a lot more to them than that. You’ll be forced to put your survival and fighting abilities to the test in a hostile environment, and you’ll discover how humankind can come together in the face of hardship. The zombie games provide a wide range of action-packed adventures that are both complex and entertaining.</p><p>Here are the greatest zombie videogames you can play right now, starting with number 10 and working your way up to our top one pick. Our list of zombie games contains tales with repercussions, resource management, traditional Capcom danger, and more. You’ll be able to discover your new zombie-filled adventure here since it covers a wide range of genres.</p><h3 id="1-Worldwar-Z"><a href="#1-Worldwar-Z" class="headerlink" title="1.Worldwar Z"></a>1.Worldwar Z</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/worldwar-z-poster.jpg"                      alt="worldwar-z-poster"                ></p><p>There isn’t much to World War Z by itself, but there isn’t a better game for mow down dozens, if not hundreds, of zombies with a group of friends or strangers. It’s based in part on the Brad Pitt film from 2013. Nonetheless, it’s mainly an excuse to repeat the film’s one distinguishing attribute: swarms of monsters that rush down streets and crash around curves like a torrent through a breached dam.</p><p>It is undeniably influenced by the Left 4 Dead series (RIP). It does, however, have several modern game mainstays like selectable classes &amp; permanent progression. You may choose to play as a Horror flick, who gets extra health by rapidly killing enemies, a Fixer, who places traps in safe areas, or even one of four additional classes. Whatever character you select to level up first, you’ll get to fire a lot of lead into sliding walls of decaying flesh.</p><h3 id="2-Dying-Light-The-Following"><a href="#2-Dying-Light-The-Following" class="headerlink" title="2.Dying Light: The Following"></a>2.Dying Light: The Following</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dying-light-the-following-poster.jpg"                      alt="dying-light-the-following-poster"                ></p><p>Running over zombies has never been more fun. The Foregoing is really a DLC for Dying Light that eliminates much of the parkour again from the original game and instead places you behind the wheel of a car across a stretch of nearly spotless countryside. Splatter zombies spewing gore and leave tire tracks in their guts as you drive across the fields, attempting daring jumps. Just make sure you don’t get a monster head caught in your wipers.</p><h3 id="3-State-of-the-Decay-2"><a href="#3-State-of-the-Decay-2" class="headerlink" title="3.State of the Decay 2"></a>3.State of the Decay 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/state-of-the-decay-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="state-of-the-decay-2-poster"                ></p><p>Unlike Project Zomboid, which concentrates primarily on the concept of being an ordinary person in an unfair position, the States of Decay series tries to keep you amused with the beautiful midwestern countryside and Gorey entertaining combat even while your supplies run out and zombies smash down your gate.</p><p>The introduction of multiplayer in States of Decay 2 is probably the most intriguing new feature. Inviting people to help protect and hunt for your village greatly expands the scope of procedurally produced tales. It also enables you to put to the test all of those zombie outbreak survival tactics you’ve spent way too much time talking with your pals.</p><h3 id="4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019"><a href="#4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019" class="headerlink" title="4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)"></a>4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resident-evil-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="resident-evil-2-poster"                ></p><p>Resident Evil 2’s sequel treads a thin line between the sluggish horror of the original Resident Evil game and the quicker (but still methodical) action of the post-Resident Evil 7 period. It succeeds in being both a worthy homage to the first Resident Evil 2 and the most important, playable RE games in years as a result of this. The key is the zombies, as you’d expect from a game that ranks among the zombie games. Even while the remake’s mobility and shooting controls seem to be more contemporary and streamlined, each zombie can only take so many shots - even headshot - before resurrecting. Even immediately in front of your eyes, or perhaps a few minutes later, when you believe you are secure.</p><p>In the remake of Resident Evil 2, the perfect aim isn’t enough to ensure your life. The most essential element is caution since you save ammunition by firing to stun rather than kill. You could even decide the zombies can take the passageway while you retain the ammunition. It’s still not as terrifying as the other major Resident Evil remake in terms of sheer dread. However, the Resident Evil 2’s remake is undoubtedly more enjoyable to play, earning it a place on our list of zombie games.</p><h3 id="5-The-Walking-Dead"><a href="#5-The-Walking-Dead" class="headerlink" title="5.The Walking Dead"></a>5.The Walking Dead</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-walking-dead-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-walking-dead-poster"                ></p><p>You play Lee Everett, a convicted murderer who takes in an orphaned young girl called Clementine as his charge. You’ll make choices that will have significant repercussions for your group members when you meet more survivors. The worst part is that you develop feelings for the people in your group. As a consequence, when bad things happen, you’ll feel as though you’ve just seen a real-life buddy being eaten rather than a video game character. People will die, unexpected events will occur, and choices will need to be made. You’ll have to live with the repercussions.</p><h3 id="6-The-HD-Remaster-of-Resident-Evil"><a href="#6-The-HD-Remaster-of-Resident-Evil" class="headerlink" title="6.The HD Remaster of Resident Evil"></a>6.The HD Remaster of Resident Evil</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remaster-of-resident-evil-poster.png"                      alt="remaster-of-resident-evil-poster"                ></p><p>The utter loneliness of becoming one of the last humans with a heartbeat within some several-mile radius is something that the first Resident Evil gets right that many zombie games miss out on. Resident Evil High-Definition Remaster is a somewhat updated version of Resident Evil GameCube update from 2002, maintaining the terrible desolation in its entirety. Don’t get us wrong: the 2015 remake should have done a lot more (those pre-rendered backdrops are starting to seem a little fuzzy these days), but what’s there is still a landmark survival horror classic.</p><p>The Resident Evil update isn’t just one of the best zombie games because of its unique perspective on the undead; it’s one of the best zombie games because of its unique perspective what to do, in particular, with one that seems to have ceased to move. You would like to make sure you put zombies down with just a headshot or burn their bodies afterward because if you don’t, the monster known as a “crimson head” will spring up later. Shivers go down your spine just uttering the word.</p><h3 id="7-The-Last-of-Us"><a href="#7-The-Last-of-Us" class="headerlink" title="7.The Last of Us"></a>7.The Last of Us</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-last-of-us-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-last-of-us-poster"                ></p><p>The Last of Us, which won the game of Year in 2013, is still the best zombie game ever made over six years later. It sends you on a perilous cross-country journey across a largely post-human America. The planet is filled with desperate weapon survivalists, a totalitarian government, and violent rebel groups, apart from mushroom-brained undead with fangs eager to tear your jugular out. The greatest part is that you have to do it all with a sassy young woman who alternates between making fun of you and rescuing your life.</p><p>The journey of Joel and Ellie would be both dark and terrifying.

Just make sure you don’t get a monster head caught in your wipers.</p><h3 id="3-State-of-the-Decay-2-3"><a href="#3-State-of-the-Decay-2-3" class="headerlink" title="3.State of the Decay 2"></a>3.State of the Decay 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/state-of-the-decay-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="state-of-the-decay-2-poster"                ></p><p>Unlike Project Zomboid, which concentrates primarily on the concept of being an ordinary person in an unfair position, the States of Decay series tries to keep you amused with the beautiful midwestern countryside and Gorey entertaining combat even while your supplies run out and zombies smash down your gate.</p><p>The introduction of multiplayer in States of Decay 2 is probably the most intriguing new feature. Inviting people to help protect and hunt for your village greatly expands the scope of procedurally produced tales. It also enables you to put to the test all of those zombie outbreak survival tactics you’ve spent way too much time talking with your pals.</p><h3 id="4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019-3"><a href="#4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)"></a>4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resident-evil-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="resident-evil-2-poster"                ></p><p>Resident Evil 2’s sequel treads a thin line between the sluggish horror of the original Resident Evil game and the quicker (but still methodical) action of the post-Resident Evil 7 period. It succeeds in being both a worthy homage to the first Resident Evil 2 and the most important, playable RE games in years as a result of this. The key is the zombies, as you’d expect from a game that ranks among the zombie games. Even while the remake’s mobility and shooting controls seem to be more contemporary and streamlined, each zombie can only take so many shots - even headshot - before resurrecting. Even immediately in front of your eyes, or perhaps a few minutes later, when you believe you are secure.</p><p>In the remake of Resident Evil 2, the perfect aim isn’t enough to ensure your life. The most essential element is caution since you save ammunition by firing to stun rather than kill. You could even decide the zombies can take the passageway while you retain the ammunition. It’s still not as terrifying as the other major Resident Evil remake in terms of sheer dread. However, the Resident Evil 2’s remake is undoubtedly more enjoyable to play, earning it a place on our list of zombie games.</p><h3 id="5-The-Walking-Dead-3"><a href="#5-The-Walking-Dead-3" class="headerlink" title="5.The Walking Dead"></a>5.The Walking Dead</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-walking-dead-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-walking-dead-poster"                ></p><p>You play Lee Everett, a convicted murderer who takes in an orphaned young girl called Clementine as his charge. You’ll make choices that will have significant repercussions for your group members when you meet more survivors. The worst part is that you develop feelings for the people in your group. As a consequence, when bad things happen, you’ll feel as though you’ve just seen a real-life buddy being eaten rather than a video game character. People will die, unexpected events will occur, and choices will need to be made. You’ll have to live with the repercussions.</p><h3 id="6-The-HD-Remaster-of-Resident-Evil-3"><a href="#6-The-HD-Remaster-of-Resident-Evil-3" class="headerlink" title="6.The HD Remaster of Resident Evil"></a>6.The HD Remaster of Resident Evil</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remaster-of-resident-evil-poster.png"                      alt="remaster-of-resident-evil-poster"                ></p><p>The utter loneliness of becoming one of the last humans with a heartbeat within some several-mile radius is something that the first Resident Evil gets right that many zombie games miss out on. Resident Evil High-Definition Remaster is a somewhat updated version of Resident Evil GameCube update from 2002, maintaining the terrible desolation in its entirety. Don’t get us wrong: the 2015 remake should have done a lot more (those pre-rendered backdrops are starting to seem a little fuzzy these days), but what’s there is still a landmark survival horror classic.</p><p>The Resident Evil update isn’t just one of the best zombie games because of its unique perspective on the undead; it’s one of the best zombie games because of its unique perspective what to do, in particular, with one that seems to have ceased to move. You would like to make sure you put zombies down with just a headshot or burn their bodies afterward because if you don’t, the monster known as a “crimson head” will spring up later. Shivers go down your spine just uttering the word.</p><h3 id="7-The-Last-of-Us-3"><a href="#7-The-Last-of-Us-3" class="headerlink" title="7.The Last of Us"></a>7.The Last of Us</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-last-of-us-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-last-of-us-poster"                ></p><p>The Last of Us, which won the game of Year in 2013, is still the best zombie game ever made over six years later. It sends you on a perilous cross-country journey across a largely post-human America. The planet is filled with desperate weapon survivalists, a totalitarian government, and violent rebel groups, apart from mushroom-brained undead with fangs eager to tear your jugular out. The greatest part is that you have to do it all with a sassy young woman who alternates between making fun of you and rescuing your life.</p><p>The journey of Joel and Ellie would be both dark and terrifying. The decaying, gloomy surroundings set the tone for the stealth&#x2F;survival action, making the tension almost unbearable.</p><h3 id="8-Back-4-Blood-3"><a href="#8-Back-4-Blood-3" class="headerlink" title="8.Back 4 Blood"></a>8.Back 4 Blood</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/back4blood-poster.jpg"                      alt="back4blood-poster"                ></p><p>Back 4 Blood is an action-packed cooperative first-person action from the highly popular Left 4 Dead series developers. You’re smack dab in the middle of a battle with the Ridden. That once hosts of a terrible infection have evolved into frightening monsters intent on eating civilization’s ruins. It’s up to you and your allies to take the battle to the enemy, eliminate the Ridden, and recapture the planet, with humanity’s extinction on the line.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a

Screen recorders are incorporated into several Android handsets. There are also hundreds of third-party screen recorder programs available for download, both free and premium. If you’re still looking for the finest <strong>android movie recorder</strong>, you may get the AZ screen recorder app right now. With its built-in technique, though, recording your iPhone’s screen is simple.</p><h3 id="For-Android"><a href="#For-Android" class="headerlink" title="For Android"></a>For Android</h3><p>AZ Screen Recorder is the most effective screen recording program I’ve discovered so far on Android, although there are many more others. It’s ad-free, doesn’t need root, has no restriction on recording time, and doesn’t apply watermarks. It’s not a terrible bargain at all. After you’ve downloaded it, go through the following steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/az-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="az screen recorder"                ></p><ul><li>Start the AZ Screen Recorder app by selecting it from your app drawer.</li><li>You’ll notice a four-button overlay emerge. The gear icon allows you to change the video recording parameters, including resolution, bit rate, and frame rate. Press Back to go to the home screen when you’re finished.</li><li>Start the app or browse to the screen you wish to capture and press “Record”.</li><li>AZ overlay’s AZ button has a red camera shutter icon. The video is about to start recording. Until you’re ready to stop recording, continue to use your phone usually.</li><li>Remove your finger from the notification shade when you’re done. You have the option of pausing or stopping the recording from the AZ notification.</li></ul><h3 id="For-iOS"><a href="#For-iOS" class="headerlink" title="For iOS"></a>For iOS</h3><p>Fortunately, if you understand how to activate it, taking a screenshot or recording a video on your iPhone’s screen is exactly as simple as before. Using your iPhone, here’s how to record your screen and locate the movie once it has been saved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="iphone screen recorder"                ></p><ul><li>Then touch “Control Center” in the Settings app. Select “Customize Controls” from the drop-down menu. Look for the phrase “Screen Recording.” Tap the green + symbol next to it if it’s not already in the “Include” section. It should now appear in the “Include” column.</li><li>If you have an iPhone X or later, slide down from the top-right corner to activate the Control Center; swipe up if you have an iPhone 8 or older. The home button on an iPhone may be accessed by swiping up from the bottom of the display.</li><li>Press and hold the “Record” button. This feature is activated by pressing the Record button for three seconds, after which the button becomes red and begins recording. The time will be red in the top left corner, indicating that you’re still recording.</li><li>Press the red time indication at the upper left of the screen, then tap “Stop” to stop recording. Alternatively, you may open the Control Center and press the record button once again.</li></ul><h2 id="Wrapping-UP"><a href="#Wrapping-UP" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping UP"></a>Wrapping UP</h2><p>Recording all of your favorite movies on your Mac or PC is now easy and enjoyable.

Some of these film clips may be useful or necessary for you to save for future reference.

Because of video recording or capture software, you may now record a movie on your pc at any moment.</p><p>Free screen recorders might be an excellent place to start, and several outstanding alternatives are out there. Additionally, you have the option to download or stream the recording to a service of your choosing. Several powerful methods for recording movies will be discussed in this article for PCs, Macs, and smartphones.

You have the option of selecting Full Screen, Custom, or Target Window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-screen.jpg"                      alt="filmora screen recorder"                ></p><p>You may use the Microphone icon to pick the microphone you’ll be using to record audio, and you can use the Speakers icon to activate or mute the computer’s speakers while the screen recording session is in progress.</p><p>The Settings icon may be seen in the window’s bottom right corner; click it to access additional settings.

Record Film on Mac with QuickTime"></a>Part 2. Record Film on Mac with QuickTime</h2><p>If you’re using an earlier version of MacOS than Mojave, you may always use QuickTime Player to record your screen (as well as audio recording). QuickTime recordings aren’t easy to edit, yet they are one of the most straightforward ways to <strong>record movie mac</strong>. QuickTime Player may be found in Catalina and Big Sur, among other places.</p><p>From the Launchpad, open QuickTime Player. Check the Launchpad’s Other folder if you don’t see it. When the app is open, go to the Menu Bar and choose File. On the drop-down menu, select New Screen Recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-screen-recording-option.jpg"                      alt="quicktime screen recording"                ></p><p>An option to allow screen recording may appear on your computer’s screen. Enter system preferences by clicking Open System Preferences. Select QuickTime Player and check the box. QuickTime Player may need to be restarted. (If you don’t, go on to the next step.) When QuickTime has restarted, go to File, then New Screen Recording.</p><p>Three buttons on the left allow you to take a screenshot, while two appear in the center to record the screen. Optional features include the ability to add or delete mouse clicks, the ability to utilize the built-in mic, and the ability to choose the video’s destination. The Record button is positioned to the right of the Record Entire Screen and Record Selected Portion buttons.</p><p>When you’re done, go to the menu bar and choose Stop Recording from the drop-down menu, as seen below. If you have a Touch Bar on your Mac, you may also press the relevant icon.</p><p>Click File in the menu bar, then Save from the drop-down menu to save your recording. To save the recording, choose a suitable save place (if you’ve not done so) and a name for it, then click Save to confirm.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Record-Movie-on-the-Phone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Record-Movie-on-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Record Movie on the Phone"></a>Part 3. How to Record Movie on the Phone</h2><p>Nowadays, capturing your phone’s screen is relatively simple. Screen recorders are incorporated into several Android handsets. There are also hundreds of third-party screen recorder programs available for download, both free and premium. If you’re still looking for the finest <strong>android movie recorder</strong>, you may get the AZ screen recorder app right now. With its built-in technique, though, recording your iPhone’s screen is simple.</p><h3 id="For-Android"><a href="#For-Android" class="headerlink" title="For Android"></a>For Android</h3><p>AZ Screen Recorder is the most effective screen recording program I’ve discovered so far on Android, although there are many more others. It’s ad-free, doesn’t need root, has no restriction on recording time, and doesn’t apply watermarks. It’s not a terrible bargain at all. After you’ve downloaded it, go through the following steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/az-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="az screen recorder"                ></p><ul><li>Start the AZ Screen Recorder app by selecting it from your app drawer.</li><li>You’ll notice a four-button overlay emerge. The gear icon allows you to change the video recording parameters, including resolution, bit rate, and frame rate. Press Back to go to the home screen when you’re finished.</li><li>Start the app or browse to the screen you wish to capture and press “Record”.</li><li>AZ overlay’s AZ button has a red camera shutter icon. The video is about to start recording. Until you’re ready to stop recording, continue to use your phone usually.</li><li>Remove your finger from the notification shade when you’re done. You have the option of pausing or stopping the recording from the AZ notification.</li></ul><h3 id="For-iOS"><a href="#For-iOS" class="headerlink" title="For iOS"></a>For iOS</h3><p>Fortunately, if you understand how to activate it, taking a screenshot or recording a video on your iPhone’s screen is exactly as simple as before. Using your iPhone, here’s how to record your screen and locate the movie once it has been saved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="iphone screen recorder"                ></p><ul><li>Then touch “Control Center” in the Settings app. Select “Customize Controls” from the drop-down menu. Look for the phrase “Screen Recording.” Tap the green + symbol next to it if it’s not already in the “Include” section. It should now appear in the “Include” column.</li><li>If you have an iPhone X or later, slide down from the top-right corner to activate the Control Center; swipe up if you have an iPhone 8 or older. The home button on an iPhone may be accessed by swiping up from the bottom of the display.</li><li>Press and hold the “Record” button. This feature is activated by pressing the Record button for three seconds, after which the button becomes red and begins recording. The time will be red in the top left corner, indicating that you’re still recording.</li><li>Press the red time indication at the upper left of the screen, then tap “Stop” to stop recording. Alternatively, you may open the Control Center and press the record button once again.</li></ul><h2 id="Wrapping-UP"><a href="#Wrapping-UP" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping UP"></a>Wrapping UP</h2><p>Recording all of your favorite movies on your Mac or PC is now easy and enjoyable.

Whether it’s an engineer, graphical designer, or programmer, he will prefer Linux-based operating systems and computers. Therefore, Macbook Air computers since 2008 are commonly used by information technology geeks. Nowadays, this trend has not been limited to its professional users but everyone in our circle wants to buy a cool Macbook despite its use.</p><p>Well, in this scenario using the graphical GUI might seem easy but it’s not pretty basic to that of windows. Many of us want to capture our screen either for educational purposes or entertainment but doing that on Macbook might not be so simple. However, you don’t need to panic because we have got you all covered in this article. We will see how to screen record on MacBook Air using different techniques. So let’s begin one by one in the coming sections.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Use-Keyboard-Shortcuts"><a href="#Part-1-Use-Keyboard-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Use Keyboard Shortcuts"></a>Part 1: Use Keyboard Shortcuts</h2><p>MacBook Air OS supports certain keyboard shortcuts to start screen recording and taking screenshots. You can either take a screenshot using the shortcut keys or record your screen by bringing in the tools on the screen To bring the screen recording tools menu on Mac, all you need is to press “Command + Shift + 4”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-air-os-use-keyboard-shortcuts.jpg"                      alt="macbook air os use keyboard shortcuts"                ></p><p>After pressing you will be prompted to application windows as shown in the figure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-recorder-settings.jpg"                      alt="macbook recorder settings"                ></p><p>Once the application window appears, you must know what each icon on the window means. On the left side of the window, as you can see, you can manage the screenshot of your screen either in full or of some windows or areas. Next is the middle area, which gives you two modes for screen recording, fullscreen mode to record your screen or choose a certain area to record from the screen as shown above in the figure. You can access all the recording settings before pressing to record your screen.</p><p>**<strong>Recording Settings:</strong></p><p>Before starting your screen recording it’s important to adjust for different recording settings as shown in the figure below. Just click the “options” in the main GUI of the recorder to show it up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-click-the-options.jpg"                      alt="macbook click the options"                ></p><p>You can select your destination folder for saving your records using the “save to” bar in the settings. Set the timer up to 5 and 10 seconds if you short version video. You can also set to record both visual and audio from the screen using the microphone settings. In the end, you are left with other options of showing a floating thumbnail on your recording or keeping the last settings you have done here with the “Remember last selection option”. These are the options you can adjust before starting your screen record.</p><p>To stop recording all you have to do is press the small icon that appears in the top-right corner of your desktop screen. Visit your selected destination folder of the recording and bingo you can enjoy your screen recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-stop-recording.jpg"                      alt="macbook stop recording"                ></p><p>**<strong>Other Shortcut Keys:</strong></p><p>Other shortcut keys that can be used to take screenshots and screen recording let’s have a look at the following table.</p><table><thead><tr><th>**<strong>Shortcut Key</strong></th><th>**<strong>Function</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Shift + Command + 3</td><td>Take a Full Screenshot.</td></tr><tr><td>Shift + Command + 4</td><td>Capturing a portion of the screen</td></tr><tr><td>Shift + Command + 4 + Spacebar</td><td>Take a screenshot of a certain window.</td></tr><tr><td>Shift + Command + 5</td><td>Bring you the screenshot and screen recording tools</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-2-Use-QuickTime-Player"><a href="#Part-2-Use-QuickTime-Player" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Use QuickTime Player"></a>Part 2: Use QuickTime Player</h2><p>Another hidden application in your MacBook Air utility program that already comes built-in with Mac OS is QuickTime Player. With this player, you can easily record your screen and take screenshots along the system audio as well as microphone input.

You will probably see the QuickTime player icon there. Right-click on the icon and start the new screen recorder to access the application. Or you can use the other method to access it with QuickTime open from the upper bar as shown in the figure below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-player-row-on-desktop-screen.jpg"                      alt="quicktime player row on desktop screen"                ></p><p>Once you are done with launching the GUI of the application, it’s time to learn how can you start recording now.

You can easily do it by enabling the internal microphone in the settings as shown in the figure. Once you are done with the settings it’s time to start your recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quciktime-internal-microphone.jpg"                      alt="quciktime internal microphone"                ></p><p>Click on the start recording button and you will see a new window will pop up to choose the screen recording mode from it as shown in the figure below. To record in the full-screen recording mode you just need to click randomly on the screen once and it will start recording the whole screen. Otherwise, drag and select a particular area on the screen and click start recording once shown and you will have the recording of the particular screen area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-drag-and-drop-on-screen.jpg"                      alt="quicktime drag and drop on screen"                ></p><p>Finally, if you are needed to stop recording, all you have to do is click on the QuickTime player icon in the application bar and select stop recording as shown. After doing so, you will be left with the untitled video of your recording that you can play through the player.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-stop-screen-recording-option.jpg"                      alt="quicktime stop screen recording option"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Use-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Use-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Use Filmora"></a>Part 3: Use Filmora</h2><p>Another cool way to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record your screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on Macbook Air is using Filmora.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Comprehensive-Study-Gecata’s-Game-Record-Functionality"><a href="#Comprehensive-Study-Gecata’s-Game-Record-Functionality" class="headerlink" title="Comprehensive Study: Gecata’s Game Record Functionality"></a>Comprehensive Study: Gecata’s Game Record Functionality</h2><p>It’s futile to look for another game recorder now that the Gecata game recorder is here. However, it’ll be much better if you can share that fantastic experience with the rest of the globe, right? In the end, game recording software may let you do just that. It doesn’t matter whether you’re playing Minecraft or a shooting game; being able to share your knowledge with a large group of people is always impressive. Furthermore, the cycle has become much easier for players as a result of the accelerating innovation. You may record a full-screen continuing interaction at 60 frames per second with Gecata by Movavi and save it as an MP4 movie with recommended configurations for YouTube transmission.</p><p>Gecata is a good and maybe the best option for Windows users looking for a lightweight but very functional game recording program. It also ensures a single tick, which is a slack-free action that enables you to broadcast and record at the same time. Individual hotkeys are included, allowing you to explore your game without being interrupted. It also allows you to capture videos in 4K at 120 frames per second, which is rather impressive for a gadget of this sort. Add sound from speakers and a mouthpiece to your interaction accounts, as well as webcam video, so you can share your emotions with viewers when you upload the video to YouTube or another video-sharing platform.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Gecata-Recorder’s-Highlights"><a href="#Part-1-Gecata-Recorder’s-Highlights" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Gecata Recorder’s Highlights"></a>Part 1: Gecata Recorder’s Highlights</h2><p>The Gecata game recorder comes with a free trial version, after which you can purchase the complete version for a reasonable price. The stage’s UI makes it simple to remove the unwanted content from the streams.</p><p><strong>Obtain Sound and Microphone for the Game:</strong></p><p>This Movavi game capture program allows for two-way solid capture of in-game audio files, music, and speech, as well as mouthpiece yield. You may comment on the activity as you go using Gecata by Movavi. Save sound streams as individual sound documents so you may remove bloopers without destroying the movie.</p><p><strong>Speed of Transfer:</strong></p><p>Make your videos more easily available on YouTube in HD by saving them in MP4 with the recommended parameters. Upload your video evidence on YouTube. Gecata by Movavi has improved the catch design by using YouTube suggestions, allowing you to manage your HD recordings in minutes.</p><p><strong>Following the Production:</strong></p><p>Save game footage, webcam video, and sound analysis as separate documents so you may remove bloopers without ruining your playthroughs. When you’re finished, you’ll have the choice of viewing the video in MP4, a format supported by most devices and recommended for transmission by YouTube.</p><p><strong>Sources of Information:</strong></p><p>You may use Gecata from Movavi to overlay webcam video over the game footage. Choose the size and location of the webcam window, or save it as a separate video track for further customization. Use these to quickly create expressions and statements.</p><p><strong>Screenshots to Capture:</strong></p><p>Many players like transferring screenshots of their current engagement to provide a basic notion about the video’s content and the genuine qualities of the game being played. The customer may take screen screenshots while the video is being recorded using this product.</p><p><strong>Execution:</strong></p><p>Before uploading the video to any stage, the product allows you to easily edit, convert, and adjust the file size, bit rate, outlining rate, and other characteristics of the video. The device may record and encode video up to multiple times faster when used in conjunction with NVIDIA NVENC and Intel HD Graphics equipment performance increases.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Gecata-to-Record-Games"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Gecata-to-Record-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Gecata to Record Games"></a>Part 2: How to Use Gecata to Record Games</h2><p>Movavi Gecata is a relatively new continuing interaction recording program that costs just $19.95 and has all of the features that gamers want. PC games are more well-known than they have ever been, and players are eager to document their interactions. Some people have to transmit to their friends, while some do it professionally as Twitch or YouTube decorations. Regardless of the intended use, make sure you think about Gecata in light of the surrounding reality of interest.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download and install Gecata by Movavi</strong></p><p>After the download is complete, launch the.exe file and follow the Installation Wizard’s instructions. It will just take a few seconds to finish the interaction. When it’s finished, open the program and capture whatever gameplay footage you need.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Modify the Capture Options</strong></p><p>Make sure the Capture mode in the main window is set to Game. The noises of the framework will be picked up on their own. If you need to capture your voice and face while you’re playing, enable the Microphone and Webcam on the Devices page.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Take a video of the game</strong></p><p>If you need to start recording after dispatching the game, click Start Recording in the application interface before starting the game; otherwise, start the game you want to record. To start or stop recording, use F10, and to stop, press F9. You don’t need to do anything; the game film will be stored on your hard disk as an MP4 file as a result. This is how to record games on a computer, and it couldn’t be much easier!</p><p><strong>Step 4: Save your Gameplay</strong></p><p>Change the Video quality slider to choose the output video quality. Note that high-quality game footage will take up a lot of space on your computer, so make sure you have at least 2 or 3 GB of free space before you start filming. Simply click the Capture distinct streams box to save the screen capture and camera recordings as separate documents.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#Part-3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Pros and Cons"></a>Part 3: Pros and Cons</h2><p>Gecata supports a variety of codecs, makes use of NVIDIA and Intel hardware acceleration, and can record 4K video at up to 120 frames per second. Because the audio streams are saved independently, it’s simple to cut out any bloopers without disrupting the in-game audio.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Side-by-side recording and streaming</li><li>Record gaming movies at up to 120 frames per second</li><li>Take notes on everything that happens in the game, including the sound effects and your voice.</li><li>4K video recording with Various video formats</li><li>Overlay a camera into your outstanding gameplay</li><li>Record both the games and your voice</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Watermarks on recordings in the free version</li><li>Lags with intensive games like Call of Duty and Shutter Games</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Alternative-Software-to-Gecata-to-Record-Games"><a href="#Part-4-Alternative-Software-to-Gecata-to-Record-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Alternative Software to Gecata to Record Games"></a>Part 4: Alternative Software to Gecata to Record Games</h2><p>Even though Gecata allows you to broadcast and record at the same time, it’s simple to overlay your camera and manage everything using hotkeys so you don’t have to interrupt the interaction. The user interface is simple, yet it’s functional and easy to navigate. You may record any game in 4K ultra-HD resolution, whether it’s a 2D or 3D game. It also has editing capabilities, making it one of the most popular games recording programs available. Likewise, it is membership-based, which is unusual in the game catch software industry, so you should think about it. We recommend <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora video recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as one choice. Whatever you want to record, whether it’s gaming, web player videos, continuing commentary, music, or anything else.</p><p>Furthermore, since the finest games are found on Windows PCs, the best screen recorder for games will almost always be Windows PC software. Filmora, on the other hand, is accessible for the two phases in the event of an incident. Filmora allows you to record the whole screen, a specific location, your camera, or even just a small zone around your mouse, and it outputs in all of the major formats, including MP4. The implicit manager allows you to add text, lines, call-outs, and other on-screen elements, which is useful if you want to create an educational exercise rather than merely record your continuing interaction. It can also record sound from anything playing on your PC or Mac. Filmora is a tool created just for you. It’s more than simply a game recorder; it also allows you to modify your recordings.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open Filmora Game Recorder</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/recording-01.png"                      alt="filmora screen recorder"                ></p><p>To begin, The next step is to launch the software program so that you can begin recording the gameplay without delay.

Also, to stop the recording, use the square-shaped stop button.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Organize and Share Your Recordings</strong></p><p>Finally, you may use completely customizable editing tools to alter your game recordings. To do so, use Filmora’s editor and modify your recorded gameplay files using simple to advanced editing methods.</p><p>After you’ve finished editing your recordings, click the Export option to save them to your selected place in the appropriate video format. You may also upload your recorded files straight to your YouTube channel, as well as other cloud storage services like Google Drive and OneDrive. To share your gameplays straight to your YouTube channel, just go to the YouTube navigation bar and pick the Sign-in option.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are many different types of game recording software for Windows available, and each one claims to be the best on the market. As game recording software apps are excellent for constant game screen recording, especially for gaming YouTubers that have comparable levels of engagement with their viewers. Movavi’s Gecata is a lightweight streaming and game recording application for Windows PCs that ensures a single tick of action. That is why we prefer Filmora since it is feature-rich, provides you total control over settings, and allows you to pick whether you want to use your PC’s sound or a microphone.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Watermarks on recordings in the free version</li><li>Lags with intensive games like Call of Duty and Shutter Games</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Alternative-Software-to-Gecata-to-Record-Games-1"><a href="#Part-4-Alternative-Software-to-Gecata-to-Record-Games-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Alternative Software to Gecata to Record Games"></a>Part 4: Alternative Software to Gecata to Record Games</h2><p>Even though Gecata allows you to broadcast and record at the same time, it’s simple to overlay your camera and manage everything using hotkeys so you don’t have to interrupt the interaction.
