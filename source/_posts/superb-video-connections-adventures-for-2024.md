One more addition to this series is more interesting where the player needs to pop the green bubbles available on the screen while saving the red ones.

Here is another cool and feature-rich webcam-based basketball game that can be accessed directly from browser and Mac systems as well. Players can control ball motion by moving their hands in front of the camera. Although the graphics quality of this game is above average, most players rate it lower due to messy motion detection and ball physics abilities.

This game can be played in two different modes; you can either switch to the multiplayer mode or the arcade mode. You need to collect maximum points by directing your shots very carefully and target your basket perfectly to move to the next level.
