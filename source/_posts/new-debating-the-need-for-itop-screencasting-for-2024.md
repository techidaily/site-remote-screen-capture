## Conclusion

To sum it up all, iTop screen recorder is extremely easy to operate but you have to opt for its Pro version to remove the watermark on your recording while you use its free version. Instead of opting for its Pro version, you can go for a professional video recorder. We recommend Filmora because you can record as well as edit your video to make it engaging and professional. There is no performance lag even when you record at 4K resolution and it is a better alternative to iTop screen recorder.
