While WhatsApp score highly as a communications App, their video calling software needs a little polishing. It isn’t bad, it is just being outshone by some of the other names on our list. WhatsApp, however, is the one you are most likely to have on your phone already!

Favored Features of WhatsApp:

* Many people use it because it is informal and very secure… you are less likely to have messages hacked.
* WhatsApp video quality is very good, they also offer a few filters to make you prettier.
* It’s simple to set up and easy to use. Also comes as a mobile app.
