## Essential Skills for Effective Faces on Camera

Thousands of people on YouTube and other platforms create videos with their faces incorporated at the corner of the screen. Some may wonder how this is done. It just requires one to record the computer screen and a Facecam. Previously, people used to **record Facecam and gamplay separately** and then join them using other software. With the current growth in technology, you just need to record Facecam and computer screens at the same time and directly upload your Facecam videos to YouTube or your preferred platform.

![record facecam](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-facecam-online.jpg)

A Facecam can be described as the recording of one's face in an online video. Such videos as the Let’s Play Videos usually include audio narration. This tech is nowadays commonly used in gameplays and video tutorials where many of these video makers put their faces in the corner of the screen.

## Why Use a Facecam Recorder

Generally speaking, showing your face in the tutorial videos, especially the live streaming, increases interaction with the audience. It can help make your videos more plausible and help attract more followers. Note that getting a proper tool to record both the computer screen and face simultaneously may be very time-consuming.

With that in mind, you will find that the Facecam recorder is an essential tool to help achieve that goal. Facecam recorder is one of a kind as besides recording screen and Facecam, allows the user to capture audios using features in the system or even an external microphone.

## 5 Situations People Need a Facecam

**Creating gaming videos.**
