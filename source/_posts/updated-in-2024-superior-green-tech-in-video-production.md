Applications that may be used to modify the backdrop of a video are known as [green screen software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The video timeline may be simply edited and trimmed utilising this application. They provide you with the option of changing the backdrop color of the video clip. Many of these tools let you record video with virtual background without green screen.
