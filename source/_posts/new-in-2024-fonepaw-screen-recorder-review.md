The free version comes with all the features that its premium version offers. The only limitation is that you can record up to 3 minutes of video at a time.

You can record the screen and the webcam individually as well as collectively. Similarly, you can record sound from microphone and system speaker. Among the advanced features, you can schedule recording in your absence and add real-time annotations. Check out the complete review of **FonePaw Recorder** below.

Therefore, for general users, FonePaw recording software gets the job done while professional video creators can opt for Wondershare Filmora as the best alternative.

**Cons**

* 4K recording not possible.
* Very limited editing options.
* Free version is more for testing than real usage.
