 Below, we have listed some of the most commonly asked questions regarding the use of video conferencing tools.

### Q) What are the different types of video conferencing?

1. A) There are five main types, although others may be derived from these. They are:
2. **Integrated Video Conferencing tools** – where the [camera and equipment](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are in the conference center. Like a lecture.
3. **Telepresence** – Video conferencing tools that use telepresence to mimic human interaction as closely as possible. A digital presence, if you will.
4. **[Desktop Video Conferencing tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** are the ones we are most familiar with. We all use our devices to connect to one single group video chat.
5. **Room based Video conferencing frameworks using Codec** – a video conferencing tool that is best used when someone needs to communicate with a whole room while they are moving around.
6. **Service Based** – this type of online video conferencing tool is rarely free and requires your internet service provider to do the majority of the organization on your behalf.

 Hopefully, this clears things up for you!
