## Part 2\. How to Record a WhatsApp Call on Android?

WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app among Android users. WhatsApp has literally replaced text messaging and its free audio call feature is widely used as an alternative to traditional call. At the same time, users prefer WhatsApp video call over audio call for personal communication with contacts.

That is why you will need an external screen recorder app and we recommend AZ Screen Recorder. The app is free to use and very easy to operate. With a single tap, you can record anything on the screen including WhatsApp call. Here are the steps to follow to record WhatsApp call on Android.
