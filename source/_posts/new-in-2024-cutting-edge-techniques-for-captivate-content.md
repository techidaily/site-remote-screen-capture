#### Step 1 - Setting up a video recording session

Double-click on Adobe Captivate's desktop icon to launch the software, and then head over to Microsft PowerPoint and open the presentation you'd like to record in the second monitor.

#### Step 2 - Select the application and designate the area of the screen you'd like to record

After you click on the Create button, a new window will appear on the screen. In the upper left corner of the window, you'll be able to see Screen Area and Application options.

In the Snap To section of the window, you'll be able to choose between Application Window, Application Region, and Custom Size options. Select the feature that best meets the demands of the project you are working on, and then click on the Panning drop down menu if you would like to add the panning effect to the video recording you are creating.

Hit the Record button to initiate the video recording session. You can hit the Esc or End buttons to stop recording if you are using a PC, while Mac users can perform the same action by hitting Cmd + Enter keys.

#### Step 4 - Publish the video
