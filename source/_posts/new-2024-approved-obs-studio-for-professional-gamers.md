## Part 1\. Best OBS Settings for Game Recording

There is no better free alternative to OBS when it comes to game recording. Even though it is completely free, there is no dearth of standard and advanced settings for gamers to record and stream their gameplay like professionals. Here are some of the important settings on OBS Studio how to record games properly.

**Stream:** Under Stream Settings, you can live stream your gameplay. You have to choose an online platform like Twitch, YouTube, Facebook and connect your account. Once the account of the platform gets connected with OBS, you can live stream your gameplay and all your followers on that online platform can witness your gameplay live.

**Output:**Under Output Settings, you can configure your streaming and recording parameters. Focusing mainly on recording, you can set the path to save the recorded videos, recording quality as required, recording file format, encoders and much more. You can also set the output mode to Advanced to configure advanced audio settings and enable replay buffer option.

**Video:** Under Video settings, you get to select base resolution as well as output resolution. The higher the resolution, the larger will be the file size of the recorded video. You can also select FPS value which is extremely important from gameplay recording perspectives.

**Audio:** When you are talking about how to record ps4 gameplay with OBS, you have to pay equal attention to recording audio from the game as well as your commentary. Under Audio settings, you can set sample rate, channels, desktop audio, mic and auxiliary audio and likewise.

**Hotkeys:** Hotkeys are keyboard shortcuts that you have to press for quick actions such as start recording, pause and stop recording. You can mute audio, turn off video capture device momentarily, switch between scenes, take screenshots, and much more. Go to Hotkeys tab and set the hotkeys for instant action without using your mouse.

**Advanced:** There are various advanced configurations and parameters available under Advanced settings. You can decide process priority and set it to high for faster processing. You can select video renderer and color format which are significant. If you are live streaming and you want to stream with a delay, you can set it here.
