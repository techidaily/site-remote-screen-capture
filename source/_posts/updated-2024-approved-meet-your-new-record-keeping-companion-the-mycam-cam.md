If you want to record your webcam video, MyCam serves the purpose perfectly. But it can record only webcam videos and hence, this makes the application less versatile for different purposes. You cannot record from multiple video sources such as you cannot record screen and webcam together. That is why we recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best alternative to MyCam.
