If you have an older iPhone or iOS version, you may find it difficult to spot Voice Memos app. You can find Voice Memos app on iPhone 7 by taking the following steps.

* Swipe down and in the search box, type “voice memos”.
* Voice memos app should appear on the search results instantly. You can also check the folder name where the app is present.
* For now, tap on Voice Memos icon on the search result to open it immediately.

Why I cannot see Voice Memos app?

If you have the latest iPhone or iOS version, you can access Voice Memos directly from Control Center. However, if you do not see Voice Memos icon, you need to activation Voice Memos first.

Go to Settings and tap on your Apple ID. Go to iCloud option and toggle on Voice Memos option. Now, Voice Memos icon should appear on Control Center for quick access.

How long can voice memos be on iPhone?

There is no limit of recording time when it comes to recording a voice memo or note through Voice Memos app. However, the recording can stop abruptly if there is no more space available on your iPhone.
