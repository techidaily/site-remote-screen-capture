You can play PlayStation games on your Android phone and PC using ePSXe (short for enhanced PSX emulator).

* It allows you to pause, resume, and save your gameplay from the point you last left it.
* Dual-player and split-screen modes are available. Additionally, you can also use external gamepads to play your favorite video games.
