![quicktime screen recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-new-movie-recording.jpg)

* First, check whether your device has a pre-installed QuickTime installed in it. Generally, you can search the QuickTime application in the search bar of your Mac, and if it's available then click on the icon. If it's not, then visit Apple's official website and you will find the download page for the QuickTime player from there. Then download it and install it on your device.
* After opening QuickTime player on any Mac, the user will be available with a bunch of tools and options such as "Files", "view", "edit" tabs, etc. From there you will need to select the "Files" option and click on it. When you open this, a dropdown menu will appear on your screen which will have several items shown in it.
* From the dropdown menu select "New Movie Recording" and the application will start the screen recording with a timer of 3 seconds. Now go to Minecraft and play the game as per your wish. Then when you are done with recording Minecraft, click on the stop button available as an overlay on your screen and the game will be saved to your device.

## Way 3\. Use OBS Studio

OBS studio is believed to be a powerhouse for content creators especially because of its editing and video creation options.

If you are a Minecraft gamer and you want to record your gaming sessions with any screen recorder, then OBS studio would be the best option for you. It has features for recording the screen in different resolutions and you can trim and cut the clip after your recording session too.

The premium version of this application also provides different audio editing enhanced features and the process to record Minecraft with OBS Studio is as follows:

If it's not present then you can add a scene by clicking on the plus sign right next to the "Scenes" option. This option should be present on the left corner of your screen.
* Then, scroll down to the option that says "Sources". The sources option will be generally on the bottom panel of the interface you are using.
* Here you will see an array of tiny buttons from which you will need to click the small plus button and it will let you access the options panel.
* In the options panel select the option that says "Display Capture" and if you are getting a small popup on your screen, then click "Ok".
* Now, click on the bottom right corner of the screen and select the "Settings" option from there. Then select the "output" option from the available options.
* Then in the "recording path" option present on your screen, you will need to select a destination folder for your output video.
