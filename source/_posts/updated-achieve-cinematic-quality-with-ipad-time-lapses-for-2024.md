Apple claims that iPad can record 30 hours of time-lapse video. You have to consider the battery charge and the storage space on your iPad.

**How do you time a video on iPad?**

You cannot set a fixed time duration for capturing a video on iPad. You have to manually start and stop recording a video on iPad. However, you can always trim the video duration as per your requirements. You can use iMovie app to trim the video duration and time your video accordingly.

This comes to 240 seconds which is 4 minutes.
