#### 3. Use for Home Surveillance

Everyone wants additional security in the living premises and public places as well.

The great news for you all is that even the basic webcams can meet your surveillance related desires with ease. They work perfectly with the latest motion detection software and can activate sensor-based monitoring 24x7\. The surprising fact is that these webcams can even record infrared light movements that are otherwise invisible to human eyes. Hence, they are the best solution for night time monitoring.

You will be happy to hear that internet is loaded with so many impressive games that are played with sensor-based controls.
