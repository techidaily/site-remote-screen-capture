Kazam is excellent because it offers versatility. If you do not want to record the entire screen, you will have the option to record only a selected area.

There is also no included webcam viewer. With this tool, you will have the option to pause and resume video recording. The tool is generally divided into two parts. A first part is a command-line tool, which is basically the one that is responsible for capturing and encoding. The second part is an interface that exposes the functionality of the program.
