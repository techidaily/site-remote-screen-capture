Would you like to play the classic Nintendo 3DS games on your latest android devices? This article is meant for you if that's the case!

The days of buying dedicated handheld consoles to fulfill entertainment needs on the go are long gone. The Gameboy, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation Vita, and Sony's PSP were the most commonly used gaming consoles a decade ago. As times change, we increasingly rely on our smartphones for a variety of activities. Smartphones are now so powerful that they can replace laptops and desktop computers because of their chipsets. Gaming on the go is by far the most intriguing development of smartphones.

Nintendo 3DS is certainly at the top of the list of most popular handheld gaming consoles, perhaps alongside the PSP and Gameboy. It is undeniable that the Nintendo 3DS has some of the greatest classic games of all time, and one can totally understand why people might be tempted to pick one up - even in 2024\. Since our smartphones are easily accessible, buying a new device just to play games that are already available would be a waste of resources. Using emulators, you are able to play games developed for other hardware on your phone.

If you search on google for the best 3DS emulators for Android, you will have limitless options, and you can easily get confused among so many choices, such as RetroArch, DraStic DS Emulator, NDS4droid, etc. We are lending you a helping hand as we have prepared a list of top 10 3ds emulators that you can use on your android smartphones and have the classic gaming experience.

In addition, it includes additional configuration features such as automatic saving and loading game states, custom controls, etc.

**Pros:**

* Game state saving, auto-saving, and loading
* Customizable screen sizes & orientation

**Cons:**

* Crashes & lags occasionally
* Advertisements take up too much space.
* A quad-core or high-end CPU with RAM above 2GB is needed.

#### Conclusion

These are some of the best 3DS emulators that you can download and use on your android devices. Now think for a second that how it will feel to play all those classic games again on your mobile devices. You can recall your childhood memories. So, donâ€™t waste your money buying dedicated consoles and try these emulators today. For people who play games on computer and want to save the highlights of their games, use a [screen recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to capture the screen will be a good choice. I would recommend Filmora, a powerful video recorder and editor tool to help save high quality videos on computer with ease.

Would you like to play the classic Nintendo 3DS games on your latest android devices? This article is meant for you if that's the case!

The days of buying dedicated handheld consoles to fulfill entertainment needs on the go are long gone. The Gameboy, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation Vita, and Sony's PSP were the most commonly used gaming consoles a decade ago. As times change, we increasingly rely on our smartphones for a variety of activities. Smartphones are now so powerful that they can replace laptops and desktop computers because of their chipsets. Gaming on the go is by far the most intriguing development of smartphones.

Nintendo 3DS is certainly at the top of the list of most popular handheld gaming consoles, perhaps alongside the PSP and Gameboy. It is undeniable that the Nintendo 3DS has some of the greatest classic games of all time, and one can totally understand why people might be tempted to pick one up - even in 2024\. Since our smartphones are easily accessible, buying a new device just to play games that are already available would be a waste of resources. Using emulators, you are able to play games developed for other hardware on your phone.

If you search on google for the best 3DS emulators for Android, you will have limitless options, and you can easily get confused among so many choices, such as RetroArch, DraStic DS Emulator, NDS4droid, etc. We are lending you a helping hand as we have prepared a list of top 10 3ds emulators that you can use on your android smartphones and have the classic gaming experience.

![nds-boy-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nds-boy-poster.png)

**Price:** Free

The best Android 3DS emulator allows you to play any game that runs on the handheld Nintendo 3DS gaming console, such as Final Fantasy, Super Mario Bros., and Pokemon Sage. Its features are robust, with support for file formats such as .rar, .zip, .7z, and .nds, among others. Additionally, the emulator requires a large amount of RAM, as lower RAM would slow down the emulator. In addition, it includes additional configuration features such as automatic saving and loading game states, custom controls, etc.

**Pros:**

* Game state saving, auto-saving, and loading
* Customizable screen sizes & orientation

**Cons:**

* Crashes & lags occasionally
* Advertisements take up too much space.
* A quad-core or high-end CPU with RAM above 2GB is needed.

#### Conclusion

These are some of the best 3DS emulators that you can download and use on your android devices. Now think for a second that how it will feel to play all those classic games again on your mobile devices. You can recall your childhood memories. So, donâ€™t waste your money buying dedicated consoles and try these emulators today. For people who play games on computer and want to save the highlights of their games, use a [screen recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to capture the screen will be a good choice. I would recommend Filmora, a powerful video recorder and editor tool to help save high quality videos on computer with ease.
