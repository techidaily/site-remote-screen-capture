## Part 3\. Alternative Way to Record Screen

CamStudio is an easy-to-use and completely free screen recorder, but it lacks several useful features. First of all, there is no basic editing option available. The output file format is limited. There are very limited customizable configuration settings available. Moreover, CamStudio is only suitable for Windows users. The user interface is outdated, and it is not suitable for recording very high-quality screen videos such as gameplay. That is why there is a need for a better CamStudio alternative.

If you are looking for a professional [screen recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), we recommend Wondershare Filmora. Filmora comes with an inbuilt video editor, and therefore, you can get your recorded video ready for publishing after recording.

Many professional video creators use Filmora for recording screen, gameplay, as well as webcam PiP mode. Here are the steps to record the screen with Filmora.
