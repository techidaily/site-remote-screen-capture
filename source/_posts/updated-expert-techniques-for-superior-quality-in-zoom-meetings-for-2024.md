The Zoom video meeting and chat app has become a wildly famous hostage to billions of folks studying, working, and socializing from home. Despite several security concerns that arose alongside Zoom's social platform, it now features end-to-end encryption and other ways to protect your privacy. In addition, it has also resolved chats from "Zoombombing" and other privacy flaws. All in all, Zoom is adding new features daily as per the people's concerns, and the introduction of **Zoom video filters** is among them.

The **Zoom meeting filters** help make your video meetings experience a little less weird -- and hopefully avoid Zoom anxiety and Zoom fatigue.

If you haven’t done it yet, first install the Zoom Client for Meetings software. Next, install the **Snap Camera** app.

Now, open the **Snap Camera** app to see yourself in the camera viewer.

**Step 2: Find the filters**

Look for the filters among the different categories or search them by typing a term in the **search** field.

Choose **Start Video** to turn your Video on, and see yourself switched with selected **Snapchat filters for Zoom**.

You can then switch among different filters anytime during the session. Place the **Snap Camera** app accordingly, so it's next to the Zoom app for easy management. Switch an extra filter in Snap Camera, and change your appearance.

To return to your regular appearance and background, click the filter you just selected. Then, turn off the Snap Camera app to close the Snap Camera altogether.

Go back to the Zoom video window, click the arrow next to the **Video** button again, and switch the source back to your primary Camera.

Open the **Snap Camera** app and choose the Settings icon in the upper right.

Toggle the button that says **Run Snap Camera on System Startup**. Now the app will automatically launch when you sign in to Windows.

## **Part 4: Tips for Making a High-Quality Zoom Meeting**

Learning how to set up Zoom meeting filters is straightforward, alright, but you can also optimize Zoom meetings for the best experience.

Given below are a few tips to improve the quality of the Zoom meetings:

#### 1\. Mirror Effect

The mirror effect enables by default and lets you flip the video display during the conference. To enable or disable this feature, click the **Settings** icon from the top-right corner of the Zoom window (when not in a conference), select Video from the left pane, and check or uncheck the Mirror my video box from the right, respectively.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![zoom meeting mirror video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-mirror-my-video.jpg)

#### 2\. Appearance Touchup

This feature makes your camera visuals less crispy. It's a great effect to distract other meeting participants with the imperfections your sleepy face or clothes have when you're right out of bed.

![zoom meeting touch appearance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-touch-my-appearance.jpg)

#### 3\. Virtual Backgrounds

Virtual backgrounds let you hide those wrinkled or untidy bedsheets or wet towels that are generally hovering around your messy home. When enabled, you can choose a pleasant environment or other scenic beauty visible to other participants during the session.

![change virtual background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-change-virtual-background.jpg)

#### 4.Prevent Screen Sharing

You can keep all the ignorant participants from sharing their screens accidentally while you're discussing a serious matter. For this purpose, hit the up-facing arrow beside **the Share** **Screen** option from the bottom of the camera window, click **Advanced Sharing** **Options**, and choose the **Only Host** radio button from the **Who can share section** that appears on the following box.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![zoom meeting sharing screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-only-host-sharing-screen.jpg)

#### 5\. Mute Participants

You can mute all the participants in one go and remove unnecessary voices appearing like a fish market. To do this, select **the Manage Participants** option from the bottom of the camera screen and then hit the **Mute All** button from the **Participants** pane's bottom left corner.

You can also select the **Mute** button next to each participant's name in the Participants pane to mute them individually.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **Conclusion**

The process of applying Zoom video filters is simple, and learning how to set up a third-party camera for Snapchat filters for Zoom is even simpler. For the latter, however, you are required to install an add-in that is freely available from the vendor's official website. To conclude, being one of the most straightforward solutions (i.e., free in most scenarios) for video conferences and virtual business meetings, almost all the corporate professionals around the globe prefer Zoom.

The Zoom video meeting and chat app has become a wildly famous hostage to billions of folks studying, working, and socializing from home. Despite several security concerns that arose alongside Zoom's social platform, it now features end-to-end encryption and other ways to protect your privacy. In addition, it has also resolved chats from "Zoombombing" and other privacy flaws. All in all, Zoom is adding new features daily as per the people's concerns, and the introduction of **Zoom video filters** is among them.

The **Zoom meeting filters** help make your video meetings experience a little less weird -- and hopefully avoid Zoom anxiety and Zoom fatigue.

If you haven’t done it yet, first install the Zoom Client for Meetings software. Next, install the **Snap Camera** app.

Now, open the **Snap Camera** app to see yourself in the camera viewer.

**Step 2: Find the filters**

Look for the filters among the different categories or search them by typing a term in the **search** field.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![find snap filters zoom](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/find-snap-filters-zoom.jpg)

After you’ve selected a filter, open **Zoom** and start or join a meeting.

Now, change the camera source that Zoom will use over the video screen. Select the arrow icon beside the **Start Video** button and choose **Snap Camera** to switch to.

**Step 3: Change Filters**

![change snap filters zoom](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/change-snap-filters-zoom.jpg)

Source: pcmag.com

Choose **Start Video** to turn your Video on, and see yourself switched with selected **Snapchat filters for Zoom**.

You can then switch among different filters anytime during the session. Place the **Snap Camera** app accordingly, so it's next to the Zoom app for easy management. Switch an extra filter in Snap Camera, and change your appearance.

To return to your regular appearance and background, click the filter you just selected. Then, turn off the Snap Camera app to close the Snap Camera altogether.

Go back to the Zoom video window, click the arrow next to the **Video** button again, and switch the source back to your primary Camera.

**Step 4: Snap Camera Settings**

![snap camera settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/snap-camera-settings-zoom.jpg)

Open the **Snap Camera** app and choose the Settings icon in the upper right.

Toggle the button that says **Run Snap Camera on System Startup**. Now the app will automatically launch when you sign in to Windows.

## **Part 4: Tips for Making a High-Quality Zoom Meeting**

Learning how to set up Zoom meeting filters is straightforward, alright, but you can also optimize Zoom meetings for the best experience.

Given below are a few tips to improve the quality of the Zoom meetings:

#### 1\. Mirror Effect

The mirror effect enables by default and lets you flip the video display during the conference. To enable or disable this feature, click the **Settings** icon from the top-right corner of the Zoom window (when not in a conference), select Video from the left pane, and check or uncheck the Mirror my video box from the right, respectively.

![zoom meeting mirror video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-mirror-my-video.jpg)

#### 2\. Appearance Touchup

This feature makes your camera visuals less crispy. It's a great effect to distract other meeting participants with the imperfections your sleepy face or clothes have when you're right out of bed.

![zoom meeting touch appearance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-touch-my-appearance.jpg)

#### 3\. Virtual Backgrounds

Virtual backgrounds let you hide those wrinkled or untidy bedsheets or wet towels that are generally hovering around your messy home. When enabled, you can choose a pleasant environment or other scenic beauty visible to other participants during the session.

![change virtual background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-change-virtual-background.jpg)

#### 4.Prevent Screen Sharing

You can keep all the ignorant participants from sharing their screens accidentally while you're discussing a serious matter. For this purpose, hit the up-facing arrow beside **the Share** **Screen** option from the bottom of the camera window, click **Advanced Sharing** **Options**, and choose the **Only Host** radio button from the **Who can share section** that appears on the following box.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![zoom meeting sharing screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-only-host-sharing-screen.jpg)

#### 5\. Mute Participants

You can mute all the participants in one go and remove unnecessary voices appearing like a fish market. To do this, select **the Manage Participants** option from the bottom of the camera screen and then hit the **Mute All** button from the **Participants** pane's bottom left corner.

You can also select the **Mute** button next to each participant's name in the Participants pane to mute them individually.

## **Conclusion**

The process of applying Zoom video filters is simple, and learning how to set up a third-party camera for Snapchat filters for Zoom is even simpler. For the latter, however, you are required to install an add-in that is freely available from the vendor's official website. To conclude, being one of the most straightforward solutions (i.e., free in most scenarios) for video conferences and virtual business meetings, almost all the corporate professionals around the globe prefer Zoom.
