* Xbox one
* PlayStation Vita
* iOS
* Android
* MacOS
* Linux, and even;
* PlayStation 4

Are you wondering what makes this game interesting? Well, players tend to act as a character who takes complete control over their late grandfather's already dilapidated farm. And, this farm is located in a place known as Stardew Valley. It must be noted that this game is entirely open-ended as it enables players to take on diverse activities. These activities include:

* Ore mining
* Growing of crops
* Raising some livestock
* Selling of produce, and;
* Crafting of goods

More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.

For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools. Bear in mind that Stardew Valley has a lot to offer its players. And, the addition of Ginger Island has made the game very popular.

However, those who already play the Stardew Valley game will be capable of venturing into the quests and solving them. To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island.

### 2.The Island trader

![stardew-valley-ginger-island-the-island-trader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-the-island-trader.jpg)

Among the first things, every farmer will have on their to-do list is to get a hold of some elements on the Island. You can do this easily in the Stardew Valley Ginger Island if you are ready to put in the work to find the golden walnuts. When you restore the Island farmhouse, you can pay ten golden walnuts to build the trader's hut. From here, you can purchase tropical crop seeds and any other unique items.

### 3.Pirates and Mermaids

![stardew-valley-ginger-island-pirates-and-mermaids](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-pirates-and-mermaids.jpg)
