The development of ps2 emulator for android is ongoing. A ps2 emulator for android won't work properly unless you have the right hardware. Until these applications are completely functioning and ready for everyone, they aren't ready for use.

The greatest ps2 emulator for android so far is DamonPS2 Pro, one of the three apps on our list. Compared to Play! and PPSS2 Golden, it has less trouble with most PS2 games. It also has the most devoted following and is the closest to a fully functional PS2 emulator for Android on the market at the moment.

All of these applications, however, are still in the early stages of development. For all these years, you've been pleading for an Android phone with a PS2 emulator so you can play your favorite games on it.
