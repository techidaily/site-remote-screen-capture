In the Age of Information, we no longer struggle with the means of communication, because the modern technologies have enabled us to obtain or disseminate any information we want.

Screencasting is one of the modern methods of communication that was made possible by the advancement of digital images and computer technologies. Today, anyone with enough knowledge about a certain topic can create a tutorial, a Slideshare presentation or video lessons from the comfort of their homes. All they need is a computer and a screencasting software that enables them to capture the desktop screen.

The amount of possibilities screencasting offers is nearly limitless and what type of screencast video you are going to make depends almost entirely on your creativity. However, before you embark on this adventure, there are a few things you should know about screencasting software, which is why we are going to provide you with all the information you'll need to choose the right screencasting software.

## Part 1: The Advantages of Using Screencasting Software

What type of screencast videos you are going to make depends on what you want to communicate. For example, large companies can easily make screencasts to welcome their new team members and walk them through their new duties. In this manner, producing a screencast can save time that can be invested in more pressing issues than the guiding of the newcomers through each step of their new job.

Furthermore, a screencast can serve as a guide that answers all sorts of frequently asked questions. Instead of writing detailed explanations that take a lot of time to read, you can create a screencast that can be shared as many times you want or posted on your website to help users of your products get all the answers they need.

Screencasts can be utilized as an effective way to make attractive sales pitches, product demos, software walk-throughs and even for giving the feedback to your clients or customers. In addition, screencast videos can be used for educational purposes, since a screencast is a perfect tool for the production of a tutorial on literally any subject you can think of.

To make things even better, screencasts can be used for fun, because capturing the gameplay of your favorite video game and sharing it online is easy, all you need is a great screencasting software and you can share your gaming skills with the rest of the world.

## Part 2: Key Features You Should Look For When Picking the Screencasting Software?

Your ideas will not look as good in the real world as they did when you imagined them if you don't have the right tools to produce them. That is why picking the right screencasting software capable of high-end performances is so important. You can find a lot of material on the Internet about the best screencasting options currently available on the market, but the information about the features you have to consider before you purchase a software that enables you to produce screencasts is often scarce.

Testing each software you find in the top ten articles will take too much of your time, so instead, you should take a close look at the list of the software's features and make sure that its video recording and video editing options are powerful enough to create visually impressive videos. Here are the key features you should pay close attention to when choosing your new screencasting software.

#### 1. Capture options

The amount of creative freedom provided by the software's capture options is directly related to the quality of screencasts you'll be able to make. If the software you are using doesn't allow you to specify the area of the screen you want to capture or if it can only produce low-quality videos, then the screen recorder you are thinking of buying is not your best option. A good screencasting software should offer plenty of different video file sizes, audio recording options as well as the option to record footage with your webcam while simultaneously capturing the screen of your computer.

#### 2. Video and audio editing tools

We all make mistakes, the important thing is to know how to correct them. Almost all screen recordings need to go through the video editing process, simply because they often contain mistakes that shouldn't be included in the final cut of the video. Audio editing options are equally important, since you can accidentally record background noises during a screen capturing session, and being able to remove them right away without using pricy audio editing software can save you a lot of money.

#### 3. How easy is it to use?

You don't have to be a film industry professional in order to be able to use a screen recording software, although some of these computer programs are needlessly complicated and require a professional level of video making skills. The screen capturing process should be simple and fun, which is why it is better to choose the screencasting software that enables you to set up the screen recording sessions quickly.

#### 4. Saving capacity

How good a screen recording software really is, depends on its video output options. The size options for the video files you are making when capturing a screen, the number of different video file formats in which that file can be saved or the software's export options should all play a role in the process of making a decision which screencasting software you should buy. Look for screencasting software products that allow you to save your videos in commonly used file formats like MP.4 or that use  encoder, because you may experience problems if you try to upload AVI or WMW video files to an online video sharing platform.

Exporting video files directly from the software to YouTube of Twitch is a huge advantage since it allows to save an enormous amount of time on waiting for the files to be exported from the software and then upload them to the Internet.

## Part 3: So, Which Screencasting Software Should You Choose?

We've covered just a fraction of the factors that must be taken into account before deciding to purchase a certain screencasting software product. Paying attention to frame rates as well as live broadcast features can help you narrow down the list of screen recorders worth considering. The type of screencast you want to make should also help you decide which software to buy because if you just want to make a short screen recording you don't really need the**HD** option, so buying a software that lets you create [**4K**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) videos isn't the right choice for you. On the other hand, if the video quality is your priority, then a 4K video option is a must, but the number of Annotations the software product offers may not be so important.

A good Screencasting software should be well-equipped, user-friendly and easy to use, since its main purpose is to make the screen recording process effortless, so you can focus on the quality of the content you are producing.

A good Screencasting software should be well-equipped, user-friendly and easy to use, since its main purpose is to make the screen recording process effortless, so you can focus on the quality of the content you are producing.

In the Age of Information, we no longer struggle with the means of communication, because the modern technologies have enabled us to obtain or disseminate any information we want.

Screencasting is one of the modern methods of communication that was made possible by the advancement of digital images and computer technologies. Today, anyone with enough knowledge about a certain topic can create a tutorial, a Slideshare presentation or video lessons from the comfort of their homes. All they need is a computer and a screencasting software that enables them to capture the desktop screen.

The amount of possibilities screencasting offers is nearly limitless and what type of screencast video you are going to make depends almost entirely on your creativity. However, before you embark on this adventure, there are a few things you should know about screencasting software, which is why we are going to provide you with all the information you'll need to choose the right screencasting software.

## Part 1: The Advantages of Using Screencasting Software

What type of screencast videos you are going to make depends on what you want to communicate. For example, large companies can easily make screencasts to welcome their new team members and walk them through their new duties. In this manner, producing a screencast can save time that can be invested in more pressing issues than the guiding of the newcomers through each step of their new job.

Furthermore, a screencast can serve as a guide that answers all sorts of frequently asked questions. Instead of writing detailed explanations that take a lot of time to read, you can create a screencast that can be shared as many times you want or posted on your website to help users of your products get all the answers they need.

Screencasts can be utilized as an effective way to make attractive sales pitches, product demos, software walk-throughs and even for giving the feedback to your clients or customers. In addition, screencast videos can be used for educational purposes, since a screencast is a perfect tool for the production of a tutorial on literally any subject you can think of.

To make things even better, screencasts can be used for fun, because capturing the gameplay of your favorite video game and sharing it online is easy, all you need is a great screencasting software and you can share your gaming skills with the rest of the world.

## Part 2: Key Features You Should Look For When Picking the Screencasting Software?

Your ideas will not look as good in the real world as they did when you imagined them if you don't have the right tools to produce them. That is why picking the right screencasting software capable of high-end performances is so important. You can find a lot of material on the Internet about the best screencasting options currently available on the market, but the information about the features you have to consider before you purchase a software that enables you to produce screencasts is often scarce.

Testing each software you find in the top ten articles will take too much of your time, so instead, you should take a close look at the list of the software's features and make sure that its video recording and video editing options are powerful enough to create visually impressive videos. Here are the key features you should pay close attention to when choosing your new screencasting software.

#### 1. Capture options

The amount of creative freedom provided by the software's capture options is directly related to the quality of screencasts you'll be able to make. If the software you are using doesn't allow you to specify the area of the screen you want to capture or if it can only produce low-quality videos, then the screen recorder you are thinking of buying is not your best option. A good screencasting software should offer plenty of different video file sizes, audio recording options as well as the option to record footage with your webcam while simultaneously capturing the screen of your computer.

#### 2. Video and audio editing tools

We all make mistakes, the important thing is to know how to correct them. Almost all screen recordings need to go through the video editing process, simply because they often contain mistakes that shouldn't be included in the final cut of the video. Audio editing options are equally important, since you can accidentally record background noises during a screen capturing session, and being able to remove them right away without using pricy audio editing software can save you a lot of money.

#### 3. How easy is it to use?

You don't have to be a film industry professional in order to be able to use a screen recording software, although some of these computer programs are needlessly complicated and require a professional level of video making skills. The screen capturing process should be simple and fun, which is why it is better to choose the screencasting software that enables you to set up the screen recording sessions quickly.

#### 4. Saving capacity

How good a screen recording software really is, depends on its video output options. The size options for the video files you are making when capturing a screen, the number of different video file formats in which that file can be saved or the software's export options should all play a role in the process of making a decision which screencasting software you should buy. Look for screencasting software products that allow you to save your videos in commonly used file formats like MP.4 or that use  encoder, because you may experience problems if you try to upload AVI or WMW video files to an online video sharing platform.

Exporting video files directly from the software to YouTube of Twitch is a huge advantage since it allows to save an enormous amount of time on waiting for the files to be exported from the software and then upload them to the Internet.

## Part 3: So, Which Screencasting Software Should You Choose?

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

We've covered just a fraction of the factors that must be taken into account before deciding to purchase a certain screencasting software product. Paying attention to frame rates as well as live broadcast features can help you narrow down the list of screen recorders worth considering. The type of screencast you want to make should also help you decide which software to buy because if you just want to make a short screen recording you don't really need the**HD** option, so buying a software that lets you create [**4K**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) videos isn't the right choice for you. On the other hand, if the video quality is your priority, then a 4K video option is a must, but the number of Annotations the software product offers may not be so important.

A good Screencasting software should be well-equipped, user-friendly and easy to use, since its main purpose is to make the screen recording process effortless, so you can focus on the quality of the content you are producing.
