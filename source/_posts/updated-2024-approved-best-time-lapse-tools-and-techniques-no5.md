### 1\. How do you do a timelapse video on iPhone?

Following a few simple steps, you can easily timelapse a video on your iPhone; you only need to place your iPhone on a tripod, turn on the camera, and press the time-lapse icon. Point out the subject you want to timelapse on, and then hold and tap the area you want to focus on.

### 2\. Does time-lapse record sound?

Experts say that while shooting a time-lapse video, the device can't record the audio, and hence the audio doesn't get recorded; moreover, the effect is visible after the recording is completed.

You must use a third-party application to adjust the video's sound effects. Some of the latest applications also offer the audio feature, and you can browse the internet to learn more about them.

### 3\. Can you screen record a timelapse iPad?

Firstly, it is possible to record a timelapse on an iPad. With the help of the time-lapse option, the camera can capture various pictures at the selected time interval. Later on, a video is generated using all the captured images. The report says that the time-lapse feature is only available on iOS 8 or higher.
