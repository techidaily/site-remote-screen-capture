Once you have opened the website on your laptop or desktop, all you need to do is simply copy the meeting code or link that has been sent to you by the host of the session and paste it into the “Enter a code or link” text box.

## Part 4: How to Join Google Meet Using Link?

Make your way over to the Google Calendar website and you will find all your events for a certain day displayed on your screen.
