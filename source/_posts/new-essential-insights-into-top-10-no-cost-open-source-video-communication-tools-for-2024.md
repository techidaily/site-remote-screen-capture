3. **Telepresence** – Video conferencing tools that use telepresence to mimic human interaction as closely as possible. A digital presence, if you will.

5. **Room based Video conferencing frameworks using Codec** – a video conferencing tool that is best used when someone needs to communicate with a whole room while they are moving around.
6. **Service Based** – this type of online video conferencing tool is rarely free and requires your internet service provider to do the majority of the organization on your behalf.

 You will need a screen to watch others on, and you may want optional other equipment. A Video conferencing codec unit is used to convert audio and visual files into language the computer understands. Any other hardware and software is optional but can be used to optimize your experience.

### Q) What is the video conferencing advantages and disadvantages?

1. A) Video Conferencing has some advantages and disadvantages. Some of the benefits are that it connects remote workers and remote learners, saves travel costs, avoids travel time, vehicle costs, or maintenance, and can even be used in substitute for an on-site visit. Best of all, perhaps, it lets you head-hunt your team from across the globe.

 Some of the disadvantages of online video conferencing tools is that there is a little lag to use them, that the highest resolution camera systems can be pricey, and that you need a lot of bandwidth to run them properly.
