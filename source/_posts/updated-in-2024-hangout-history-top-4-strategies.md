Google Hangouts is a popular platform for digital communication, and the platform is widely used by professionals for text conversations and video meetings.

In fact, there are many companies that organize online seminars, and you can record Google Hangout sessions so that you can view them any time you want.

Apart from meetings and webinars, you can record Hangout calls as per your requirement.
