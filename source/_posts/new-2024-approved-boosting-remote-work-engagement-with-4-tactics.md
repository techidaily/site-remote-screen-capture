In fact, there are many companies that organize online seminars, and you can record Google Hangout sessions so that you can view them any time you want.

Apart from meetings and webinars, you can record Hangout calls as per your requirement.

## Part 1\. Record Hangouts Default Recording Option

The reason why professionals prefer Google Hangouts over its competitors is that there is a default recording option available. Therefore, they can record all the video meetings and webinars for records and future references. However, this Google Hangouts recording feature is only available if you have subscribed to the paid service of G Suite Enterprise or G Suite Enterprise Education. If you have a subscription to any of these two services, here are the steps for Google hangout recording

Step 1: Open your web browser and visit hangouts.google.com.

Step 2: If you are logged into your account, start a meeting by clicking on Video Call option.
