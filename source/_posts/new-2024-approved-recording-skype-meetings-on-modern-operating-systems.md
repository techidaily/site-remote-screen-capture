* one way is to open it from the Skype for Business main window by pressing the down arrow or drop-down menu next to the settings icon. Then select “Tools” and “Recording Manager” from the list.

To prepare it for sharing with other participants, click on the “Publish” button. It will open a “Save and Publish” window where you can name the recording file, specify the location to save, and under the options chose what parts of the meeting to include i.e. video, audio, panorama video, messaging, and presented content.
