In the age of the global pandemic that was caused by COVID-19, social distancing is one of the best ways to prevent this infamous disease from spreading. [Video chat apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allow us to keep in touch with our friends and family during these difficult times without jeopardizing anyone’s safety. Mac, iPhone, or iPad users don’t have to think much about which video chat app they are going to choose as FaceTime is both free and easy to use.

Android operating systems don’t come with FaceTime’s equivalent, which is the reason why their users have to find a video chat app that best suits their needs. So, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best free FaceTime for Android alternatives.

The best part is that you don’t have to spend a single cent to be able to communicate with a friend who has an iPhone from your Android device. Here are the ten best free video chat alternatives to FaceTime on Android.

Besides being one of the most popular [cross-platform video chat apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) ever created, Skype is also remarkably easy to use, as you just need a webcam and a microphone to start a video call.

All Skype to Skype calls are free while calling landlines, mobile phones, or sending messages is only possible if you purchase Skype credit. Furthermore, the app offers the group call feature, although a single group call cannot have more than **24 participants.**

Besides giving you the option to video chat with 16 friends at the same time, Snapchat also offers the possibility to send video snaps or photos that disappear just seconds after you sent them to all of your contacts.

However, calling landlines or mobile phones that don’t have Snapchat installed is impossible, as you can only use this app to video chat with people who are already using it. Doodling over the video while the call is still in progress, applying or creating photo and video filters and discovering where your friends hang out are just a few among countless options Snapchat provides.
