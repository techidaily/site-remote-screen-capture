## Top Screen Recording Apps Without Time Restrictions

Video editing is one of the most common and useful tools in today’s environment because of the up rise of social media platforms, mainly: YouTube, Instagram, TikTok etc. So, video making and sharing is no longer a way of enjoying yourself but also a way to earn your lively hood. Now in case of shorter videos these variables really don’t really matter but when longer videos are to be made, normally for the purposes of education, game-streaming or documentaries these parameters can be the deciding and limiting factors. And from these factors the problem of time limited video recording is discussed below.

Default video recorders have a predefined limit to record for a certain time, which is a problem for lengthy videos and resetting the recording process can be very exhausting at times. So, to make impeccable videos, certain parameters have to be checked, other than the scene and setting itself, these parameters include video length, its quality and proper editing. Also, to tackle this problem the time-less recording or screen recording with no time limit is introduced. By using this tool long videos can be made without pause and later unwanted parts can be easily edited out of the video. There are different platforms available for the time-less screen recording, which are discussed below.

**Pros:**

* Records screen and webcam audio.
* Enhances the captures images, sounds, captions and arrows.
* It can add commentary.
* The compatible OS is windows only.
* It is a lightweight software.
* Records without any watermarks.

**Cons:**

* Application gives an outdated perception.
* Sometimes works with lag.

To conclude the article, I would say that there is a variety of screen recorders available in the market and most of them offer video recording without any restrictions of time limit. So which program is the best of them all; now depends mainly up on you, because if you have smaller and simpler tasks to perform then you require a lightweight software and contrarily if you have a professional and meticulous job to perform then a more powerful software like Filmora should be your choice.
