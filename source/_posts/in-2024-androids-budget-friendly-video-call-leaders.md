![ FaceTime Alternative: Snapchat  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-video-chat.jpg)

With a user base of more than 210 million people, Snapchat is easily one of the best video chat apps for Android and iPhones. Besides giving you the option to video chat with 16 friends at the same time, Snapchat also offers the possibility to send video snaps or photos that disappear just seconds after you sent them to all of your contacts.

However, calling landlines or mobile phones that don’t have Snapchat installed is impossible, as you can only use this app to video chat with people who are already using it. Doodling over the video while the call is still in progress, applying or creating photo and video filters and discovering where your friends hang out are just a few among countless options Snapchat provides.

Once you’ve installed the app, you can receive multimedia messages, start video and conference calls, or simply exchange text messages through chat.

However, you can only communicate with friends that already have WhatsApp installed on their devices, while calling landlines or emergency numbers with this app is not possible. WhatsApp features an impressive collection of GIFs and emojis that make all your conversations more entertaining, and you can also use the app to take photos or record voice messages.
