You will get a few seconds to go to PS4 emulator and start playing your game. Press F9 to stop recording when your gameplay is over.

## Way 3\. How to Record Video on PS4 with Capture Card

If you do not want to install a PS4 emulator on your computer, you can purchase a capture card to connect your PS4 to your computer. Your computer screen will literally turn into a TV screen which you use to play on PS4\. This does not make the gameplay lag, which is a common case when you use PS4 emulator to stream gameplay on PS4\. In order to record your gameplay with Capture Card, you can use any screen recorder. In fact, there are some capture cards that have inbuilt screen recorder. Here are the steps to follow for gameplay recording PS4 using Capture card.

Step 1: Connect PS4, capture card and your computer through HDMI cable.

Step 2: The USB or data cable should go from Capture card to your computer. The PS4 should be connected to your TV.

Step 3: Turn on PS4 and go to Settings on your TV screen. From Settings, go to System> System Information to check if PS4 software is updated. This is to ensure that what you see on your TV screen should also be on your laptop.

Step 4: On your computer, you can use any online screen recorder. If you have any inbuilt screen recorder that comes with your capture card, you can use the same. Start your gameplay and start recording on your computer.

## The Bottom Line

Hopefully, you have understood how to record videos on PS4\. If your gameplay is less than 60 minutes most of the time, you can do the recording with PS4 default screen recorder. However, for professional recording of your gameplay, we recommend you use Filmora to record gameplay on PSA via your computer. You can edit any part of the video and add transitions and video efforts to make it more eye-catching.
