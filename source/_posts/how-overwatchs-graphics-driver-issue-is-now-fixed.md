### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 A faulty or outdated graphics driver could interfere with Oculus Link and its performance. To fix the potential problem and ensure a smooth experience with Oculus Rift or Rift S, you need to keep your graphics driver up to date.

There are mainly two ways to update your graphics driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ) for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.)

 The **Pro version** of Driver Easy comes with **full technical support** . If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

After updating your graphics driver, restart your PC and try again.

 Then check if you still get the message “Oculus has detected a problem with your graphics drivers”.

If the issue persists, check out the next fix.

### Fix 3: Install the latest version of Overwolf

 Some users have reported that the Overwolf app could interfere with Oculus and cause it to disconnect. But the good news is that you don’t have to uninstall Overwolf now, as the support team of Overwolf has been aware of this issue and already released a fix. You can install the latest version available for download[here](https://content.overwolf.com/downloads/setup/latest/beta.html) .

 If you’ve installed the fixed Overwolf version and still get the error message of Oculus has detected a problem with your graphics drivers, you can contact **[@Overwolf Support](https://twitter.com/OverwolfSupport)**  Twitter for help.

### Fix 4: Uninstall video capture/recording software

 Some users have reported that they fixed the Oculus graphics driver problem by uninstalling**Bandicam (video capture software)** or**OBS Studio (video recording software)** . It appears that Oculus Link doesn’t support video capture or video recording software. So if you have video capture software installed on your PC, maybe uninstalling it could help you fix the issue. Also, don’t forget to use CCleaner to clean the registry after uninstallation.

If this method doesn’t work for you, take a look at the next one.
