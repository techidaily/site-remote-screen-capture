Now you can click the start button to record a video and after you are done you can instantly edit it to change the contrast, brightness, and many more.

### 3\. Filmora

Filmora is another application that can be a great alternative to Screencastify because of its robust tools and efficient user interface. It has become a popular name for video recording as well as editing applications amongst users. The main reason for its popularity is because of its availability in different operating systems.
