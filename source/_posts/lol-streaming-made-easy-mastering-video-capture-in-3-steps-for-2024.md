#### **1\. LOL Built-In-Function**

![lol-built-in-function](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lol-built-in-function.png)

Using League of Legends' built-in replay function is the easiest way to record the game. You can also download it separately. A replay button will appear after your match has ended. You can click on this button to watch the replay of your match, and you can also download the replay and save it to your device if you want to. In our opinion, it is the best and most convenient way to record your gameplay because, in this case, you don't need to download any software separately. Everything is built-in here. All you need to do is just play the game and leave the rest to the replay function.

Here is the process for recording gameplay through the built-in method:

* After you start a game, wait until it is over.
* Click on the download button after the match ends. It is situated alongside "Advanced Options" at the top of the screen.
* Wait for a few seconds. This file will be saved in your League of Legends highlights folder.

#### **2\. Using Filmora Screen Recording Option**

You might be thinking of film as a video editing program, but this program serves multiple purposes. Besides editing your videos, you can also use this program to record your screen. So, if you want to record your LOL gameplay, you can use Filmora for this purpose. You can download the latest version of Filmora (Filmora X) from the official website of Wondershare and start using it for free. It can record your gameplay at 1080p high-resolution and up to 60 fps max.

The benefit of using Filmora for recording LOL gameplay is that editing your video is much easier with Filmora. You won't need to download a separate editing program. All you need to do is just record your gameplay with Filmora, import it to your Filmora timeline, and do your desired editing. You can also share your video directly to Youtube using Filmora. It is one of the best video editing programs available in the market right now, and you can easily fine-tune your videos and gameplays so that they look more appealing to your audience.

The steps of recording your gameplay with Filmora are as follows:

* First of all, make sure that Filmora is downloaded into your system. If it is not downloaded, then download and install it from the official website of Filmora.
* Now run the program, and you will see a very user-friendly interface in front of you.
