MNML Screen recorder does not require rooting and the device has been worked hard on to raise the limit of resolutions where it capped up to 1080p. Android has made it incapable of reaching a particular record rate with bit rates up to 24Mbps.

Pros

* The user interface is as neat as possible without any distraction
* No advertisements
* Set the timer where the application automatically turns to dark themes soothing your eyes. The user interface is highly customizable.
* High quality resolution
* Navigate the screen recordings as intended
* Devoids rooting
* Record footage while the internet is turned off

Cons

* If the "Stop on Shake" feature is activated the ongoing screen recording can pause with the slightest dislocation or when users shake the device.
* Pauses all recording by default if the screen gets turned off when the "Screen off feature" is turned on.
