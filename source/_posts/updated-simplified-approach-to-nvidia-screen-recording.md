Therefore, you need to have GeForce Experience installed on your phone. Apart from ShadowPlay, you get a direct game streaming option, instant game settings optimization and NVIDIA graphics card updates under GeForce Experience. Here are the steps to follow to use NVIDIA record screen software to record gameplay.

Step 1: Download and install GeForce Experience from NVIDIA official website. Launch GeForce Experience from Windows Start menu.

![run nvidia shadowplay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-overlay.jpg)

Step 2: Once GeForce Experience opens, you have to click on the Share button at the top-right corner. This will open NVIDIA Share toolbar at the top of the screen.

Step 3: Along with NVIDIA Share toolbar, you will see ShadowPlay overlay UI. There are mainly three options - Instant Replay, Record, and Broadcast.

![shadowplay record button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-record.jpg)

If you do not see the overlay containing recording options, click on the Share button at the left of the NVIDIA Share toolbar.

Step 4: Start the game whose gameplay you want to record. You will be asked to permit screen recording of the game.

Step 5: Turn on Instant Replay option to save epic moments during the gameplay. Finally, click on Record option and click on Start option to start recording.

![run shadowplay recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/run-shadowplay-recorder.jpg)

Step 6: During the gameplay, you can get back NVIDIA ShadowPlay overlay by pressing Alt + Z. Top stop recording, go to Record option and click on Stop and Save option.

## Part 3\. Performance and Requirements

However, the dip could be significant if your computer does not have a high configuration. In that case, the gameplay can get slightly slow and lag at times. In a fair comparison, NVIDIA GeForce recording may take slightly more system resources than most screen recording software. This means no matter which screen recorder you use, there will always be some dip in the performance of the game, and you should learn to neglect it.

## Part 3\. Performance and Requirements

There have been concerns raised by professional gamers that when you use NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record gameplay or even broadcast gameplay live, it affects the performance of the game. After thorough experimentation, it has been found that running NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record gameplay or broadcast gameplay leads to the use of system resources. Therefore, there is a dip in the overall performance of the game of 5%-10%. Such a dip is negligible if you have a high-performance gaming computer.

However, the dip could be significant if your computer does not have a high configuration. In that case, the gameplay can get slightly slow and lag at times. In a fair comparison, NVIDIA GeForce recording may take slightly more system resources than most screen recording software. This means no matter which screen recorder you use, there will always be some dip in the performance of the game, and you should learn to neglect it.

NVIDIA record gameplay software is compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10\. It is not compatible with Linux or macOS. Here is the list of system requirements for NVIDIA ShadowPlay.

* RAM - 4GB or Higher.
* CPU - Intel Pentium G series, Intel Core i3 or higher.
* AMD FX, Ryzen 3 and higher.
* GPU - GeForce GTX 650 or Higher.
* Driver - GeForce 430.64 or later.
* Price - Free.
