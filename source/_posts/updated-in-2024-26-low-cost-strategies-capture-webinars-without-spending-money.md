## 26 Low-Cost Strategies: Capture Webinars Without Spending Money

In this world of digitization, webinars are the best online events for educating the masses and promoting products and services. If you have subscribed to any free or paid webinar, you should be ready to record the webinar so that you can go through the webinar at any future instance. Since webinars are live online events, you cannot watch them again if you do not record the webinars.

Recording a webinar is useful to understand any concept that you could not understand when it was getting broadcast. If you cannot be present all the time to attend the webinar, you can record the webinar and check it out later. In fact, you can share the recorded webinar with anyone at any time. If you want to record webinar free, we have lined up the best webinar recording software applications.

## Part 1\. Record Webinar on PC

If you want the best webinar recording software, we recommend [Filmora Screen Video Recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Therefore, it is going to be useful for both webinar presenter as well as participants. The presenter can record his webinar and trim out unnecessary parts and polish it to publish on different platforms.

The participants can always record and watch it later again for better understanding. The recording will be glitch-free and at the same resolution as you see on the screen. In fact, there is not going to be any loss of video and audio quality. Here are the steps to record webinar on PC with the best free webinar recording software.
