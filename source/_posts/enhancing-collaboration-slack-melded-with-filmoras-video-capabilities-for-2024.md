## Part 3: Slack Video Call Settings

Slack allows users to schedule a meeting with third-party apps or in Slack itself. You can just as easily have a Slack meeting using the in-built video call option.

You can either have a one-on-one video call in a DM chat or have a Slack meeting with 14 other participants through a channel video call. Either way, Slack has multiple video call settings to make your work and communication easier.

The settings tab in the video call enables you to create a name for the video call. There are also audio and video settings that can be changed to enhance the video call experience.

* [Part 2: How to Record Slack Meetings](#part2)
* [Part 3: Slack Video Call Settings](#part3)

## Part1: How to Schedule a Meeting on Slack

To schedule a meeting anywhere is a tedious task, but, luckily, not on Slack. Figuring out the free slots on your guest's schedule can now be automated using Outlook or Google Calendar app to schedule a meeting on Slack.

All it takes is a few clicks to schedule a meeting on Slack. And after you schedule a meeting, Slack also notifies you with a reminder. This way, you can never miss a Slack meeting or be late.

1.Open your Slack account and choose a workspace. In the chatbox, click on the **Shortcut** icon.

![Click Shortcut Icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/click-shortcut-icon.jpg)

2.Scroll down to find the option of **Create Event** (To schedule a meeting this way, you must first install the Outlook Calendar or Google Calendar)

![Create Slack Event](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-slack-event.jpg)

3.Enter the details to schedule Slack meeting, including the date, duration, timing, etc. If you want to view the recommended Slack meeting timings, the guests must be connected to the Outlook calendar. Click on **Create**.

Here is how you can record Slack meeting.

1.Click on the **Apps**tab on the left side menu. Click on **Add** **apps**.
