## Part 1\. How Do You Screen Record on iPhone?

iOS devices have different features, functionality, and entirely different working. Unlike Android devices, iOS deals with things differently. Due to this reason, there is a slight difference in screen recording when it comes to iPhone. Not every iPhone user knows how to enable screen recording on iPhone but don't worry; we got you. Let's share the steps for enabling your iPhone's settings.

Step 1: To enable screen recording in your iPhone, firstly head over to the 'Settings' app and then look for 'Control Center.' Tap on the 'Customize Controls' option from the Control Center screen.

![access customized controls of control center](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/screen-recording-on-iphone-1.jpg)

Step 2: Now, from the Customize Controls section, find the option of 'Screen Recording.' If the option is not available in the 'Include' section, hit the plus sign in green, and it will be moved to the 'Include' section.

![add screen recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/screen-recording-on-iphone-2.jpg)

These are the steps you should follow if you plan to enable the screen recording on your iPhone. Whereas the process for screen recorder iPhone is different and is still unrevealed. Follow the steps given below to record fun stuff from your iPhone screen.

Step 1: First of all, you should access the iPhone's Control Center by swiping the screen down from the top right corner. Or else, people having the iPhone with a home button can simply swipe up from the bottom.

Step 2: Now, you have to tap on the 'Record' option, which appears as a bigger circle with a shaded smaller circle in it.

![tap on screen recording icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/screen-recording-on-iphone-3.jpg)

Step 3: After that, it will hardly take 3 seconds, and then the Record button will turn red, indicating that the recording has been started. Now you can close the Control Center, and it will record everything going on the screen. The recording time appears in red at the top left corner.

Step 4: Once you have recorded everything, you can either stop the recording by hitting the Record button from the Control Center. Or else, tap on the red time in the top left corner and click on 'Stop.'
