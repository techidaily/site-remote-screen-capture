Your podcast's length will also vary depending on its topic, niche, or genre. The ideal size for your audience can be between 15 and 20 minutes. However, if your target audience wants more detailed, exploratory material, 45–90 minutes might be more beneficial.

### Can you create a podcast using only your phone?

## Summary

Regardless of your platform, you might still want to utilize an audio editing application to polish and perfect your interviews. A crucial ability for a podcaster is to learn remote podcast recording. By informing your guests to utilize an external mic (USB mics are acceptable) and ensuring all noises and distractions are kept to a minimum, you can help screen your guests and get them ready for the interview.
