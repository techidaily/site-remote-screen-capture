## Part 1\. How to Rotate Video in VLC on Windows

There are various reasons why you may want to rotate a video.

Here are the steps to perform VLC rotate video.

Step 1: Open VLC Media Player.

Step 2: Go to Media > Open File option and select the video file that you want to rotate.

Step 3: Once the video opens, go to Tools > Effects and Filters option.
